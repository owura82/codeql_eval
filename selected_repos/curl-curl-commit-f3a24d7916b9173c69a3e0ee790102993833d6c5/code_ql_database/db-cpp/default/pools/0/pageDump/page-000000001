 *
 * FormAdd()
 *
 * Stores a formpost parameter and builds the appropriate linked list.
 *
 * Has two principal functionalities: using files and byte arrays as
 * post parts. Byte arrays are either copied or just the pointer is stored
 * (as the user requests) while for files only the filename and not the
 * content is stored.
 *
 * While you may have only one byte array for each name, multiple filenames
 * are allowed (and because of this feature CURLFORM_END is needed after
 * using CURLFORM_FILE).
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Simple name/value pair with copied contents:
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "name",
 * CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS, "value", CURLFORM_END);
 *
 * name/value pair where only the content pointer is remembered:
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "name",
 * CURLFORM_PTRCONTENTS, ptr, CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH, 10, CURLFORM_END);
 * (if CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH is missing strlen () is used)
 *
 * storing a filename (CONTENTTYPE is optional!):
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "name",
 * CURLFORM_FILE, "filename1", CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE, "plain/text",
 * CURLFORM_END);
 *
 * storing multiple filenames:
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "name",
 * CURLFORM_FILE, "filename1", CURLFORM_FILE, "filename2", CURLFORM_END);
 *
 * Returns:
 * CURL_FORMADD_OK             on success
 * CURL_FORMADD_MEMORY         if the FormInfo allocation fails
 * CURL_FORMADD_OPTION_TWICE   if one option is given twice for one Form
 * CURL_FORMADD_NULL           if a null pointer was given for a char
 * CURL_FORMADD_MEMORY         if the allocation of a FormInfo struct failed
 * CURL_FORMADD_UNKNOWN_OPTION if an unknown option was used
 * CURL_FORMADD_INCOMPLETE     if the some FormInfo is not complete (or error)
 * CURL_FORMADD_MEMORY         if a HttpPost struct cannot be allocated
 * CURL_FORMADD_MEMORY         if some allocation for string copying failed.
 * CURL_FORMADD_ILLEGAL_ARRAY  if an illegal option is used in an array

        *//* start on the first letter *//* couldn't get the path *//* also save it where getinfo can access it: *//* remember this *//* If the path name does not look like an absolute path (i.e.: it
             does not start with a '/'), we probably need some server-dependent
             adjustments. For example, this is the case when connecting to
             an OS400 FTP server: this server supports two name syntaxes,
             the default one being incompatible with standard paths. In
             addition, this server switches automatically to the regular path
             syntax when one is encountered in a command: this results in
             having an entrypath in the wrong syntax when later used in CWD.
               The method used here is to check the server OS: we do it only
             if the path name looks strange to minimize overhead on other
             systems. *//* get out of this loop *//* end of path *//* "quote-doubling" *//* it started good *//* scan for the first double-quote for non-standard responses *//* Reply format is like
           257<space>[rubbish]"<directory-name>"<space><commentary> and the
           RFC959 says

           The directory name can contain any character; embedded
           double-quotes should be escaped by double-quotes (the
           "quote-doubling" convention).
        *//* Then continue as normal *//* First shut down the SSL layer (note: this call will block) *//* CCC - Clear Command Channel
         *//* we failed and bails out *//* FTP servers typically responds with 500 if they decide to reject

       * If the server is willing to accept the named security mechanism,
       * and does not require any security data, it must respond with
       * reply code 234/334.
       *//* we have gotten the response to a previous AUTH command *//* we don't know what to do *//* subtract one to get next *//* add one to get next *//* We don't have a SSL/TLS connection yet, but FTPS is
           requested. Try a FTPS connection now *//* We set private first as default, in case the line below fails to
           set a valid level *//* If not anonymous login, try a secure login. Note that this
           procedure is still BLOCKING. *//* We have received a 220 response fine, now we proceed. *//* 230 User logged in - already! *//* we have now received a full FTP server response *//* FIX *//* for ACCT response *//* Ok, USER failed.  Let's try the supplied command. *//* All other response codes, like:

    530 User ... access denied
    (the server denies to log the specified user) *//* 230 User ... logged in.
       (the user logged in with or without password) *//* 331 Password required for ...
       (the server requires to send the user's password too) *//* some need password anyway, and others just return 2xx ignored *//* no use for this yet *//* for USER and PASS responses *//* PBSZ = PROTECTION BUFFER SIZE.

    The 'draft-murray-auth-ftp-ssl' (draft 12, page 7) says:

    Specifically, the PROT command MUST be preceded by a PBSZ
    command and a PBSZ command MUST be preceded by a successful
    security data exchange (the TLS negotiation in this case)

    ... (and on page 8):

    Thus the PBSZ command must still be issued, but must have a
    parameter of '0' to indicate that no buffering is taking place
    and the data connection should not be encapsulated.

       * It seems directory listings either don't show the size or very

       * Example D above makes this parsing a little tricky *//*
     * It appears that there are FTP-servers that return size 0 for files when

  *//* this tcpconnect assignment below is a hackish work-around to make the
     multi interface with active FTP work - as it will not wait for a
     (passive) connect in Curl_is_connected().

     The *proper* fix is to make sure that the active connection from the
     server is done in a non-blocking way. Currently, it is still BLOCKING.

 *//* USE_ALARM_TIMEOUT *//* if the alarm time-left reached zero or turned "negative" (counted
         with unsigned values), we should fire off a SIGALRM here, but we
         won't, and zero would be to switch it off so we never set it to
         less than 1! *//* the alarm period is counted in even number of seconds *//* there was an alarm() set before us, now put it back *//* switch back the alarm() to either zero or to what it was before minus

   * alarm if it takes too long.
   *//* timeoutms not used with an async resolver *//* alarm() makes a signal get sent when the timeout fires off, and that
       will abort system calls *//* no sigaction(), revert to the much lamer signal() *//* now set the new struct *//* HPUX doesn't have SA_RESTART but defaults to that behaviour! *//* yes, we have a copy *//*************************************************************
     * Set signal handler to catch SIGALRM
     * Store the old value to be able to set it back later!
     *************************************************************//* this is coming from a siglongjmp() after an alarm signal *//* This allows us to time-out from the name resolver, as the timeout
     will generate a signal and we will siglongjmp() from that here.
     This technique has problems (see alarmfunc).
     This should be the last thing we do before calling Curl_resolv(),
     as otherwise we'd have to worry about variables that get modified
     before we invoke Curl_resolv() (and thus use "volatile"). *//* The alarm() function only provides integer second resolution, so if
       we want to wait less than one second we must bail out already now. *//* USE_ALARM_TIMEOUT defined, but no timeout actually requested *//* Ignore the timeout when signals are disabled *//* got an already expired timeout *//* HAVE_SIGNAL *//* store the old handler here *//* whether old sigact has been saved *//* store the old struct here *//*
 * Curl_resolv_timeout() is the same as Curl_resolv() but specifies a
 * timeout.  This function might return immediately if we're using asynch
 * resolves. See the return codes.
 *
 * The cache entry we return will get its 'inuse' counter increased when this
 * function is used. You MUST call Curl_resolv_unlock() later (when you're
 * done using this struct) to decrease the counter again.
 *
 * If built with a synchronous resolver and use of signals is not
 * disabled by the application, then a nonzero timeout will cause a
 * timeout after the specified number of milliseconds. Otherwise, timeout
 * is ignored.

 * hostip.c explained
 * ==================
 *
 * The main COMPILE-TIME DEFINES to keep in mind when reading the host*.c
 * source file are these:
 *
 * CURLRES_IPV6 - this host has getaddrinfo() and family, and thus we use
 * that. The host may not be able to resolve IPv6, but we don't really have to
 * take that into account. Hosts that aren't IPv6-enabled have CURLRES_IPV4
 * defined.
 *
 * CURLRES_ARES - is defined if libcurl is built to use c-ares for
 * asynchronous name resolves. This can be Windows or *nix.
 *
 * CURLRES_THREADED - is defined if libcurl is built to run under (native)
 * Windows, and then the name resolve will be done in a new thread, and the
 * supported API will be the same as for ares-builds.
 *
 * If any of the two previous are defined, CURLRES_ASYNCH is defined too. If
 * libcurl is not built to use an asynchronous resolver, CURLRES_SYNCH is
 * defined.
 *
 * The host*.c sources files are split up like this:
 *
 * hostip.c   - method-independent resolver functions and utility functions
 * hostasyn.c - functions for asynchronous name resolves
 * hostsyn.c  - functions for synchronous name resolves
 * hostip4.c  - IPv4 specific functions
 * hostip6.c  - IPv6 specific functions
 *
 * The two asynchronous name resolver backends are implemented in:
 * asyn-ares.c   - functions for ares-using name resolves
 * asyn-thread.c - functions for threaded name resolves

 * The hostip.h is the united header file for all this. It defines the
 * CURLRES_* defines based on the config*.h and curl_setup.h defines.

     * the plain old gethostbyname() work fine even for multi-threaded
     * programs.
     *
     * This AIX 4.3 or later detection is all made in the configure script.

     * Troels Walsted Hansen helped us work this out on March 3rd, 2003.
     *
     * [*] = much later we've found out that it isn't at all "completely

     *//* AIX, Digital Unix/Tru64, HPUX 10, more? *//* Redhat 8, using glibc 2.2.93 changed the behavior. Now all of a

     *
     * This wouldn't be such a big problem if older versions wouldn't
     * sometimes return EAGAIN on a common failure case. Alas, we can't
     * assume that EAGAIN *or* ERANGE means ERANGE for any given version of

     *
     * For now, we do that and thus we may call the function repeatedly and

     *
     * -------------------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * On October 23rd 2003, Dan C dug up more details on the mysteries of
     * gethostbyname_r() in glibc:
     *
     * In glibc 2.2.5 the interface is different (this has also been
     * discovered in glibc 2.1.1-6 as shipped by Redhat 6). What I can't
     * explain, is that tests performed on glibc 2.2.4-34 and 2.2.4-32
     * (shipped/upgraded by Redhat 7.2) don't show this behavior!
     *
     * In this "buggy" version, the return code is -1 on error and 'errno'
     * is set to the ERANGE or EAGAIN code. Note that 'errno' is not a
     * thread-safe variable.
     *//* DIFFERENCE *//* Linux *//* If the buffer is too small, it returns NULL and sets errno to
     * ERANGE. The errno is thread safe if this is compiled with
     * -D_REENTRANT as then the 'errno' variable is a macro defined to get
     * used properly for threads.
     *//* Solaris, IRIX and more *//*
     * The clearing of the buffer is a workaround for a gethostbyname_r bug in
     * qnx nto and it is also _required_ for some of these functions on some
     * platforms.
     *//* major failure *//*
   * gethostbyname_r() is the preferred resolve function for many platforms.
   * Since there are three different versions of it, the following code is
   * somewhat #ifdef-ridden.
   *//*
 * Curl_ipv4_resolve_r() - ipv4 threadsafe resolver function.
 *
 * This is used for both synchronous and asynchronous resolver builds,
 * implying that only threadsafe code and function calls may be used.
 *
 *//* CURLRES_IPV4 *//* CURLRES_SYNCH *//* synchronous response only *//*
 * Curl_getaddrinfo() - the IPv4 synchronous version.
 *
 * The original code to this function was from the Dancer source code, written
 * by Bjorn Reese, it has since been patched and modified considerably.
 *
 * gethostbyname_r() is the thread-safe version of the gethostbyname()
 * function. When we build for plain IPv4, we attempt to use this
 * function. There are _three_ different gethostbyname_r() versions, and we
 * detect which one this platform supports in the configure script and set up
 * the HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R_3, HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R_5 or
 * HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R_6 defines accordingly. Note that HAVE_GETADDRBYNAME
 * has the corresponding rules. This is primarily on *nix. Note that some unix
 * flavours have thread-safe versions of the plain gethostbyname() etc.

       returns 0 on http2_perform_getsock(), which results that no

 * Highlights from RFC2616 section 3.6 say:

   The chunked encoding modifies the body of a message in order to
   transfer it as a series of chunks, each with its own size indicator,
   followed by an OPTIONAL trailer containing entity-header fields. This
   allows dynamically produced content to be transferred along with the
   information necessary for the recipient to verify that it has
   received the full message.

       Chunked-Body   = *chunk
                        last-chunk
                        trailer
                        CRLF

       chunk          = chunk-size [ chunk-extension ] CRLF
                        chunk-data CRLF
       chunk-size     = 1*HEX
       last-chunk     = 1*("0") [ chunk-extension ] CRLF

       chunk-extension= *( ";" chunk-ext-name [ "=" chunk-ext-val ] )
       chunk-ext-name = token
       chunk-ext-val  = token | quoted-string
       chunk-data     = chunk-size(OCTET)
       trailer        = *(entity-header CRLF)

   The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits indicating the size of
   the chunk. The chunked encoding is ended by any chunk whose size is
   zero, followed by the trailer, which is terminated by an empty line.

 * C library. Mingw32 links with the dynamic C run-time library by default,
 * so the explicit definition of CSTATIC will keep dllimport from
 * being defined, if desired.
 *
 * MSVC defines the _DLL macro when the compiler is invoked with /MD or /MDd,
 * which means the resulting object code will be linked with the dynamic
 * C run-time library.
 *
 * Technically, it shouldn't be necessary to redefine any functions that
 * the headers for the C library should already contain. Nevertheless, this
 * is here as a safe-guard.
 *
 * TODO: Determine if these macros ever get expanded for Windows. If not,
 * the declspec expansion can probably be removed.

 * Support for Windows DLLs.
 *
 * When external source code includes header files for dynamic libraries,
 * the external source code is "importing" DLL symbols into its resulting
 * object code. On Windows, symbols imported from DLLs must be explicitly
 * indicated in header files with the __declspec(dllimport) directive.
 * This is not totally necessary for functions because the compiler
 * (gcc or MSVC) will generate stubs when this directive is absent.
 * However, this is required for imported variables.
 *
 * The LDAP libraries, i.e. liblber and libldap, can be built as
 * static or shared, based on configuration. Just about all other source
 * code in OpenLDAP use these libraries. If the LDAP libraries
 * are configured as shared, 'configure' defines the LDAP_LIBS_DYNAMIC
 * macro. When other source files include LDAP library headers, the
 * LDAP library symbols will automatically be marked as imported. When
 * the actual LDAP libraries are being built, the symbols will not
 * be marked as imported because the LBER_LIBRARY or LDAP_LIBRARY macros
 * will be respectively defined.
 *
 * Any project outside of OpenLDAP with source code wanting to use
 * LDAP dynamic libraries should explicitly define LDAP_LIBS_DYNAMIC.
 * This will ensure that external source code appropriately marks symbols
 * that will be imported.
 *
 * The slapd executable, itself, can be used as a dynamic library.
 * For example, if a backend module is compiled as shared, it will
 * import symbols from slapd. When this happens, the slapd symbols
 * must be marked as imported in header files that the backend module
 * includes. Remember that slapd links with various static libraries.
 * If the LDAP libraries were configured as static, their object
 * code is also part of the monolithic slapd executable. Thus, when
 * a backend module imports symbols from slapd, it imports symbols from
 * all of the static libraries in slapd as well. Thus, the SLAP_IMPORT
 * macro, when defined, will appropriately mark symbols as imported.
 * This macro should be used by shared backend modules as well as any
 * other external source code that imports symbols from the slapd
 * executable as if it were a DLL.
 *
 * Note that we don't actually have to worry about using the
 * __declspec(dllexport) directive anywhere. This is because both
 * MSVC and Mingw provide alternate (more effective) methods for exporting
 * symbols out of binaries, i.e. the use of a DEF file.
 *
 * NOTE ABOUT BACKENDS: Backends can be configured as static or dynamic.
 * When a backend is configured as dynamic, slapd will load the backend
 * explicitly and populate function pointer structures by calling
 * the backend's well-known initialization function. Because of this
 * procedure, slapd never implicitly imports symbols from dynamic backends.
 * This makes it unnecessary to tag various backend functions with the
 * __declspec(dllimport) directive. This is because neither slapd nor
 * any other external binary should ever be implicitly loading a backend
 * dynamic module.
 *
 * Backends are supposed to be self-contained. However, it appears that
 * back-meta DOES implicitly import symbols from back-ldap. This means
 * that the __declspec(dllimport) directive should be marked on back-ldap
 * functions (in its header files) if and only if we're compiling for
 * windows AND back-ldap has been configured as dynamic AND back-meta
 * is the client of back-ldap. When client is slapd, there is no effect
 * since slapd does not implicitly import symbols.
 *
 * TODO(?): Currently, back-meta nor back-ldap is supported for Mingw32.
 * Thus, there's no need to worry about this right now. This is something that
 * may or may not have to be addressed in the future.

 * This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that

 * configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from

  Edition)

  The basename() function shall take the pathname pointed to by path and
  return a pointer to the final component of the pathname, deleting any
  trailing '/' characters.

  If the string pointed to by path consists entirely of the '/' character,
  basename() shall return a pointer to the string "/". If the string pointed
  to by path is exactly "//", it is implementation-defined whether '/' or "//"
  is returned.

  If path is a null pointer or points to an empty string, basename() shall
  return a pointer to the string ".".

  The basename() function may modify the string pointed to by path, and may
  return a pointer to static storage that may then be overwritten by a
  subsequent call to basename().

  The basename() function need not be reentrant. A function that is not
  required to be reentrant is not required to be thread-safe.

 * Purpose:
 *  A merge of Bjorn Reese's format() function and Daniel's dsprintf()
 *  1.0. A full blooded printf() clone with full support for <num>$
 *  everywhere (parameters, widths and precisions) including variabled
 *  sized parameters (like doubles, long longs, long doubles and even
 *  void * in 64-bit architectures).
 *
 * Current restrictions:
 * - Max 128 parameters
 * - No 'long double' support.
 *
 * If you ever want truly portable and good *printf() clones, the project that
 * took on from here is named 'Trio' and you find more details on the trio web
 * page at https://daniel.haxx.se/projects/trio/

 * add_next_timeout()
 *
 * Each Curl_easy has a list of timeouts. The add_next_timeout() is called
 * when it has just been removed from the splay tree because the timeout has
 * expired. This function is then to advance in the list to pick the next
 * timeout to use (skip the already expired ones) and add this node back to
 * the splay tree again.
 *
 * The splay tree only has each sessionhandle as a single node and the nearest
 * timeout is used to sort it on.

 * curl_multi_info_read()
 *
 * This function is the primary way for a multi/multi_socket application to
 * figure out if a transfer has ended. We MUST make this function as fast as
 * possible as it will be polled frequently and we MUST NOT scan any lists in
 * here to figure out things. We must scale fine to thousands of handles and
 * beyond. The current design is fully O(1).
 *//* Free the blacklists by setting them to NULL *//* Close all the connections in the connection cache *//* clear the association *//* Clear the pointer to the connection cache *//* clear out the usage of the shared DNS cache *//* if DONE was never called for this handle *//* Firsrt remove all remaining easy handles *//* not good anymore *//* the removed may have another timeout in queue *//*
   * Simply remove all expired timers from the splay since handles are dealt
   * with unconditionally by this function and curl_multi_timeout() requires
   * that already passed/handled expire times are removed from the splay.
   *
   * It is important that the 'now' value is set at the entry of this function
   * and not for the current time as it may have ticked a little while since
   * then and then we risk this loop to remove timers that actually have not
   * been handled!
   *//* operate on next handle *//* now fill in the Curl_message with this info *//* signal via callback instead *//* if not yet in DONE state, go there, otherwise COMPLETED *//* aborted due to progress callback return code must close the
           connection *//* if there's still a connection to use, call the progress function *//* Curl_connect() failed *//* This is where we make sure that the easy_conn pointer is reset.
               We don't have to do this in every case block above where a
               failure is detected *//* disconnect properly *//* Don't attempt to send data over a connection that timed out *//* if this has a connection, unsubscribe from the pipelines *//* connection *//* Check if we can move pending requests to send pipe *//* NOTE: no attempt to disconnect connections must be made
           in the case blocks above - cleanup happens only here *//*
         * If an error was returned, and we aren't in completed state now,
         * then we go to completed and consider this transfer aborted.
         *//* do nothing *//* after we have DONE what we're supposed to do, go COMPLETED, and
         it doesn't matter what the multi_done() returned! *//* if a wildcard is set and we are not ending -> lets start again
             with CURLM_STATE_INIT *//*
         * If there are other handles on the pipeline, multi_done won't set
         * easy_conn to NULL.  In such a case, curl_multi_remove_handle() can
         * access free'd data, if the connection is free'd and the handle

         * The transfer phase returned error, we mark the connection to get

         * a protocol which uses two "channels" like FTP, as then the error
         * happened in the data connection.
         *//* if we are to retry, set the result to OK and consider the
             request as done *//* If CURLE_RECV_ERROR happens early enough, we assume it was a race
         * condition and the server closed the re-used connection exactly when
         * we wanted to use it, so figure out if that is indeed the case.

         between the easy handle and the connection

         Note that this ignores the return code simply because there's
         nothing really useful to do with it anyway! *//* we must call multi_done() here (if we still own the connection) so that
       we don't leave a half-baked one around *//* The timer must be shut down before data->multi is set to NULL,
     else the timenode will remain in the splay tree after

       request but not received its response yet, we need to close
       connection. *//* Set connection owner so that the DONE function closes it.  We can
       safely do this here since connection is killed. *//* this handle is "alive" so we need to count down the total number of
       alive connections when this is removed *//* If the 'state' is not INIT or COMPLETED, we might need to do something
     nice to put the easy_handle in a good known state when this returns. *//* it is already removed so let's say it is fine! *//* Prevent users from trying to remove same easy handle more than once *//* Verify that we got a somewhat good easy handle too *//* to make the caller of this function better detect that
                    this was either closed or handed over to the connection
                    cache here, and therefore cannot be used from this point on
                 *//* remember the most recently used connection *//* the connection is no longer in use by this transfer *//* create string before returning the connection *//* If we had an error already, make sure we return that one. But
       if we got a new error, return that. *//* if data->set.reuse_forbid is TRUE, it means the libcurl client has
     forced us to close this connection. This is ignored for requests taking
     place in a NTLM authentication handshake

     if conn->bits.close is TRUE, it means that the connection should be
     closed in spite of all our efforts to be nice, due to protocol
     restrictions in our or the server's end

     if premature is TRUE, it means this connection was said to be DONE before
     the entire request operation is complete and thus we can't know in what
     state it is for re-using, so we're forced to close it. In a perfect world
     we can add code that keep track of if we really must close it here or not,
     but currently we have no such detail knowledge.
  *//* if the transfer was completed in a paused state there can be buffered
     data left to free *//* done with this *//* called just now! *//* Stop if pipeline is not empty . *//* connection / multiplex *//* avoid this if we already aborted by callback to avoid this calling
       another callback *//* this calls the protocol-specific function pointer previously set *//* When we're aborted due to a callback return code it basically have to
       be counted as premature as there is trouble ahead if we don't. We have
       many callbacks and protocols work differently, we could potentially do
       this more fine-grained in the future. *//* Cleanup possible redirect junk *//* still waiting for the resolve to complete *//* Stop if multi_done() has already been called *//* an error if this is called
                                               after an error was detected *//* Debug-function, used like this:
 *
 * Curl_hash_print(multi->sockhash, debug_print_sock_hash);
 *
 * Enable the hash print function first by editing hash.c
 *//* The closure handle only ever has default timeouts set. To improve the
     state somewhat we clone the timeouts from each added handle so that the
     closure handle always has the same timeouts as the most recently added
     easy handle. *//* A somewhat crude work-around for a little glitch in update_timer() that
     happens if the lastcall time is set to the same time when the handle is
     removed as when the next handle is added, as then the check in
     update_timer() that prevents calling the application multiple times with
     the same timer info will not trigger and then the new handle's timeout
     will not be notified to the app.

     The work-around is thus simply to clear the 'lastcall' variable to force
     update_timer() to always trigger a callback to the app when a new easy
     handle is added *//* increase the alive-counter *//* increase the node-counter *//* Set the timeout for this handle to expire really soon so that it will
     be taken care of even when this handle is added in the midst of operation
     when only the curl_multi_socket() API is used. During that flow, only
     sockets that time-out or have actions will be dealt with. Since this
     handle has no action yet, we make sure it times out to get things to
     happen. *//* make the Curl_easy refer back to this multi handle *//* both first and last *//* first node, make prev NULL! *//* the new last node *//* end of the line *//* We add this new entry last in the list. *//* This adds the new entry at the 'end' of the doubly-linked circular
     list of Curl_easy structs to try and maintain a FIFO queue so
     the pipelined requests are in order. *//* Do the same for PSL. *//* Point to the shared or multi handle connection cache *//* for multi interface connections, we share DNS cache automatically if the
     easy handle's one is currently not set. *//* only do this if the global cache init works *//* global dns cache was requested but still isn't *//* set the easy handle *//*
   * No failure allowed in this function beyond this point. And no
   * modification of easy nor multi handle allowed before this except for
   * potential multi's connection cache growing which won't be undone in this
   * function no matter what.
   *//* Initialize timeout list for this handle *//* Prevent users from adding same easy handle more than once and prevent
     adding to more than one multi stack *//* -1 means it not set by user, use the default value *//* connection hash *//* socket hash *//*
 * multi_freeamsg()
 *
 * Callback used by the llist system when a single list entry is destroyed.
 *//*
 * multi_addmsg()
 *
 * Called when a transfer is completed. Adds the given msg pointer to
 * the list kept in the multi handle.
 *//*
 * sh_init() creates a new socket hash and returns the handle for it.
 *
 * Quote from README.multi_socket:
 *
 * "Some tests at 7000 and 9000 connections showed that the socket hash lookup
 * is somewhat of a bottle neck. Its current implementation may be a bit too
 * limiting. It simply has a fixed-size array, and on each entry in the array
 * it has a linked list with entries. So the hash only checks which list to
 * scan through. The code I had used so for used a list with merely 7 slots
 * (as that is what the DNS hash uses) but with 7000 connections that would
 * make an average of 1000 nodes in each list to run through. I upped that to
 * 97 slots (I believe a prime is suitable) and noticed a significant speed
 * increase.  I need to reconsider the hash implementation or use a rather
 * large default value like this. At 9000 connections I was still below 10us
 * per call."
 *
 *//*
 * free a sockhash entry
 *//* We remove the hash entry. This will end up in a call to
     sh_freeentry(). *//* delete the given socket + handle from the hash *//* things are good in sockhash land *//* make/add new hash entry *//* not present, add it *//* it is present, return fine *//* make sure this socket is present in the hash for this handle *//* only look for proper sockets *//* look up a given socket in the socket hash, skip invalid sockets *//* bits for 'action' having no bits means this socket is not expecting any
   action *//* settable by users with curl_multi_assign() *//* mainly to ease debugging *//* what action READ/WRITE this socket waits for *//*
 * We add one of these structs to the sockhash for a particular socket
 *//* if this state has an init-function, run it *//* changing to COMPLETED means there's one less easy handle 'alive' *//* don't bother when the new state is the same as the old state *//* MSGSENT *//* COMPLETED *//* DONE *//* TOOFAST *//* PERFORM *//* WAITPERFORM *//* DO_DONE *//* DO_MORE *//* DOING *//* DO *//* WAITDO *//* PROTOCONNECT *//* SENDPROTOCONNECT *//* WAITPROXYCONNECT *//* WAITCONNECT *//* WAITRESOLVE *//* CONNECT *//* CONNECT_PEND *//* INIT *//* always use this function to change state, to make debugging easier *//* stop all timers *//* Important: reset the conn pointer so that we don't point to memory
     that could be freed anytime *//* this is a completed transfer *//* function pointer called once when switching TO a state *//*
  CURL_SOCKET_HASH_TABLE_SIZE should be a prime number. Increasing it from 97
  to 911 takes on a 32-bit machine 4 x 804 = 3211 more bytes.  Still, every
  CURL handle takes 45-50 K memory, therefore this 3K are not significant.

  RFC 2616 3.3.1

  Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
  Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
  Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format

  we support dates without week day name:

  06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT
  06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT
  Nov  6 08:49:37 1994

  without the time zone:

  06 Nov 1994 08:49:37
  06-Nov-94 08:49:37

  weird order:

  1994 Nov 6 08:49:37  (GNU date fails)
  GMT 08:49:37 06-Nov-94 Sunday
  94 6 Nov 08:49:37    (GNU date fails)

  time left out:

  1994 Nov 6
  06-Nov-94
  Sun Nov 6 94

  unusual separators:

  1994.Nov.6
  Sun/Nov/6/94/GMT

  commonly used time zone names:

  Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 CET
  06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 EST

  time zones specified using RFC822 style:

  Sun, 12 Sep 2004 15:05:58 -0700
  Sat, 11 Sep 2004 21:32:11 +0200

 * This is used to handle speed limits, calculating how many milliseconds to

 *
 * The way it works is by having a "starting point" (time & amount of data
 * transferred by then) used in the speed computation, to be used instead of
 * the start of the transfer.  This starting point is regularly moved as
 * transfer goes on, to keep getting accurate values (instead of average over
 * the entire transfer).
 *
 * This function takes the current amount of data transferred, the amount at
 * the starting point, the limit (in bytes/s), the time of the starting point
 * and the current time.
 *
 * Returns 0 if no waiting is needed or when no waiting is needed but the
 * starting point should be reset (to current); or the number of milliseconds
 * to wait to get back under the speed limit.

         Any two of the parameters, readfds, writefds, or exceptfds, can be
         given as null. At least one must be non-null, and any non-null
         descriptor set must contain at least one handle to a socket.

       We know that we have at least one bit set in at least two fd_sets in
       this case, but we may have no bits set in either fds_read or fd_write,
       so check for that and handle it.  Luckily, with WinSock, we can _also_
       ask how many bits are set on an fd_set.

       It is unclear why WinSock doesn't just handle this for us instead of
       calling this an error.

       Note also that WinSock ignores the first argument, so we don't worry
       about the fact that maxfd is computed incorrectly with WinSock (since
       curl_socket_t is unsigned in such cases and thus -1 is the largest
       value).

 * Wait for read or write events on a set of file descriptors. It uses poll()

       *//* we want to use the _receiving_ function even when the socket turns
       out writableable as the underlying libssh2 recv function will deal
       with both accordingly *//*
         * libssh2_sftp_open() didn't return an error, so maybe the server
         * just doesn't support stat()
         * OR the server doesn't return a file size with a stat()
         * OR file size is 0
         *//* since we don't really wait for anything at this point, we want the
           state machine to move on as soon as possible so we set a very short
           timeout here *//* we want to use the _sending_ function even when the socket turns
           out readable as the underlying libssh2 sftp send function will deal
           with both accordingly *//* Sometimes, for some reason libssh2_sftp_last_error() returns
             zero even though libssh2_sftp_open() failed previously! We need
             to work around that! *//* not an sftp error at all *//* only when there was an SFTP protocol error can we extract
             the sftp error! *//*
       * NOTE!!!  libssh2 requires that the destination path is a full path
       *          that includes the destination file and name OR ends in a "/"
       *          If this is not done the destination file will be named the
       *          same name as the last directory in the path.
       *//* get those attributes *//* Since chown and chgrp only set owner OR group but libssh2 wants to
         * set them both at once, we need to obtain the current ownership
         * first.  This takes an extra protocol round trip.
         *//* if a command starts with an asterisk, which a legal SFTP command never
         can, the command will be allowed to fail without it causing any
         aborts or cancels etc. It will cause libcurl to act as if the command
         is successful, whatever the server reponds. *//*
         * SFTP is a binary protocol, so we don't send text commands
         * to the server. Instead, we scan for commands used by
         * OpenSSH's sftp program and call the appropriate libssh2
         * functions.
         *//*
         * also, every command takes at least one argument so we get that
         * first argument right now
         *//*
         * the arguments following the command must be separated from the
         * command with a space so we can check for it unconditionally
         *//* this sends an FTP-like "header" to the header callback so that the
           current directory can be read very similar to how it is read when
           using ordinary FTP. *//*
       * Support some of the "FTP" commands
       *
       * 'sshc->quote_item' is already verified to be non-NULL before it
       * switched to this state.
       *//* This is the last step in the SFTP connect phase. Do note that while
       we get the homedir here, we get the "workingpath" in the DO action
       since the homedir will remain the same between request but the
       working path will not. *//* in this case, the error wasn't in the SFTP level but for example
             a time-out or similar *//* Return the error type *//* It seems that this string is not always NULL terminated *//*
       * Start the libssh2 sftp session
       *//* tried and failed? go to next identity *//* as prev_identity evolves only after an identity user auth finished we
         can safely request it again as long as EAGAIN is returned here or by
         libssh2_agent_userauth *//* HAVE_LIBSSH2_AGENT_API *//* The agent could be shared by a curl thread i believe
           but nothing obvious as keys can be added/removed at any time *//* Connect to the ssh-agent *//* The function below checks if the files exists, no need to stat() here.
       *//* treat empty string the same way as NULL *//*
         * Unless the user explicitly specifies a public key file, let
         * libssh2 extract the public key from the private key file.
         * This is done by simply passing sshc->rsa_pub = NULL.
         *//* Out of guesses. Set to the empty string to avoid
                 * surprising info messages. *//* Nothing found; try the current dir. *//* Try ~/.ssh first. *//* If no private key file is specified, try some common paths. *//* To ponder about: should really the lib be messing about with the
           HOME environment variable etc? *//*
       * Check the supported auth types in the order I feel is most secure
       * with the requested type of authentication
       *//*
       * Figure out authentication methods
       * NB: As soon as we have provided a username to an openssh server we
       * must never change it later. Thus, always specify the correct username
       * here, even though the libssh2 docs kind of indicate that it should be
       * possible to get a 'generic' list (not user-specific) of authentication
       * methods, presumably with a blank username. That won't work in my
       * experience.
       * So always specify it here.
       *//* ssh_check_fingerprint sets state appropriately on error *//*
       * Before we authenticate we should check the hostkey's fingerprint
       * against our known hosts. How that is handled (reading from file,
       * whatever) is up to us.
       *//* Set libssh2 to non-blocking, since everything internally is
         non-blocking *//*
 * ssh_statemach_act() runs the SSH state machine as far as it can without
 * blocking and without reaching the end.  The data the pointer 'block' points
 * to will be set to TRUE if the libssh2 function returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN
 * meaning it wants to be called again when the socket is ready
 *//* as we already matched, we skip the check for known hosts *//* Before we authenticate we check the hostkey's MD5 fingerprint
   * against a known fingerprint, if available.
   *//* The fingerprint points to static storage (!), don't free() it. *//* now we write the entire in-memory list of known hosts to the
             known_hosts file *//* the found host+key didn't match but has been told to be fine
           anyway so we add it in memory *//* proceed *//* DEFER means bail out but keep the SSH_HOSTKEY state *//* unknown return codes will equal reject *//* no remotekey means failure! *//* from the knownhosts file *//* Ask the callback how to behave *//*
       * if any of the LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_* defines and the
       * curl_khmatch enum are ever modified, we need to introduce a
       * translation table here!
       *//* setup 'foundkey' *//* setup 'knownkey' *//*
       * A subject to figure out is what host name we need to pass in here.
       * What host name does OpenSSH store in its file if an IDN name is
       * used?
       *//* we're asked to verify the host against a file *//*

 * This is used to dynamically load DLLs using the most secure method available
 * for the version of Windows that we are running on.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 * filename  [in] - The filename or full path of the DLL to load. If only the
 *                  filename is passed then the DLL will be loaded from the
 *                  Windows system directory.
 *
 * Returns the handle of the module on success; otherwise NULL.
 *//* like platform == PLATFORM_DONT_CARE *//* Verify the platform identifier (if necessary) *//* Verify the Operating System version number *//* Find out Windows version *//* we're always running on PLATFORM_WINNT *//* We have no way to determine the Windows version from Windows apps,
     so let's assume we're running on the target Windows version. *//*
 * Curl_verify_windows_version()
 *
 * This is used to verify if we are running on a specific windows version.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 * majorVersion [in] - The major version number.
 * minorVersion [in] - The minor version number.
 * platform     [in] - The optional platform identifier.
 * condition    [in] - The test condition used to specifier whether we are
 *                     checking a version less then, equal to or greater than
 *                     what is specified in the major and minor version
 *                     numbers.
 *
 * Returns TRUE if matched; otherwise FALSE.

     According to the RFC1013 it is valid:
     A value equal to zero is acceptable for the width (or height),
         and means that no character width (or height) is being sent.
         In this case, the width (or height) that will be assumed by the
         Telnet server is operating system specific (it will probably be
         based upon the terminal type information that may have been sent
         using the TERMINAL TYPE Telnet option). *//* We must allow the server to echo what we sent
         but it is not necessary to request the server
         to do so (it might forces the server to close
         the connection). Hence, we ignore ECHO in the
         negotiate function
  *//* To be compliant with previous releases of libcurl

 *  The MACH_PORT_RIGHT_* definitions are used as arguments
 *  to mach_port_allocate, mach_port_get_refs, etc, to specify

 *	For kernel-selected [assigned] port names, the name is
 *	comprised of two parts: a generation number and an index.
 *	This approach keeps the exact same name from being generated
 *	and reused too quickly [to catch right/reference counting bugs].
 *	The dividing line between the constituent parts is exposed so
 *	that efficient "mach_port_name_t to data structure pointer"
 *	conversion implementation can be made.  But it is possible
 *	for user-level code to assign their own names to Mach ports.

 *  MACH_PORT_NULL is a legal value that can be carried in messages.
 *  It indicates the absence of any port or port rights.  (A port
 *  argument keeps the message from being "simple", even if the
 *  value is MACH_PORT_NULL.)  The value MACH_PORT_DEAD is also a legal
 *  value that can be carried in messages.  It indicates
 *  that a port right was present, but it died.

 *	Definition of a Mach port
 *
 *	Mach ports are the endpoints to Mach-implemented communications
 *	channels (usually uni-directional message queues, but other types
 *	also exist).
 *
 *	Unique collections of these endpoints are maintained for each
 *	Mach task.  Each Mach port in the task's collection is given a
 *	[task-local] name to identify it - and the the various "rights"
 *	held by the task for that specific endpoint.
 *
 *	This header defines the types used to identify these Mach ports
 *	and the various rights associated with them.  For more info see:

 *//*
 * These values can change from release to release - but clearly

 *  The msgh_seqno field carries a sequence number

 * In a complex mach message, the mach_msg_header_t is followed by
 * a descriptor count, then an array of that number of descriptors
 * (mach_msg_*_descriptor_t). The type field of mach_msg_type_descriptor_t
 * (which any descriptor can be cast to) indicates the flavor of the
 * descriptor.
 *
 * Note that in LP64, the various types of descriptors are no longer all
 * the same size as mach_msg_descriptor_t, so the array cannot be indexed

 *  Following the message header, if the message is complex, are a count
 *  of type descriptors and the type descriptors themselves
 *  (mach_msg_descriptor_t). The size of the message must be specified in
 *  bytes, and includes the message header, descriptor count, descriptors,
 *  and inline data.
 *
 *  The msgh_remote_port field specifies the destination of the message.
 *  It must specify a valid send or send-once right for a port.
 *
 *  The msgh_local_port field specifies a "reply port".  Normally,
 *  This field carries a send-once right that the receiver will use
 *  to reply to the message.  It may carry the values MACH_PORT_NULL,
 *  MACH_PORT_DEAD, a send-once right, or a send right.
 *
 *  The msgh_voucher_port field specifies a Mach voucher port. Only
 *  send rights to kernel-implemented Mach Voucher kernel objects in
 *  addition to MACH_PORT_NULL or MACH_PORT_DEAD may be passed.
 *
 *  The msgh_id field is uninterpreted by the message primitives.
 *  It normally carries information specifying the format

 *  The kernel uses MACH_MSGH_BITS_COMPLEX as a hint.  If it isn't on, it
 *  assumes the body of the message doesn't contain port rights or OOL
 *  data.  The field is set in received messages.  A user task must
 *  use caution in interpreting the body of a message if the bit isn't
 *  on, because the mach_msg_type's in the body might "lie" about the
 *  contents.  If the bit isn't on, but the mach_msg_types
 *  in the body specify rights or OOL data, the behavior is undefined.
 *  (Ie, an error may or may not be produced.)
 *
 *  The value of MACH_MSGH_BITS_REMOTE determines the interpretation
 *  of the msgh_remote_port field.  It is handled like a msgt_name,
 *  but must result in a send or send-once type right.
 *
 *  The value of MACH_MSGH_BITS_LOCAL determines the interpretation
 *  of the msgh_local_port field.  It is handled like a msgt_name,
 *  and also must result in a send or send-once type right.
 *
 *  The value of MACH_MSGH_BITS_VOUCHER determines the interpretation
 *  of the msgh_voucher_port field.  It is handled like a msgt_name,
 *  but must result in a send right (and the msgh_voucher_port field
 *  must be the name of a send right to a Mach voucher kernel object.
 *
 *  MACH_MSGH_BITS() combines two MACH_MSG_TYPE_* values, for the remote
 *  and local fields, into a single value suitable for msgh_bits.
 *
 *  MACH_MSGH_BITS_CIRCULAR should be zero; is is used internally.
 *
 *  The unused bits should be zero and are reserved for the kernel
 *  or for future interface expansion.

 *  It is controlled with the MACH_SEND_TIMEOUT
 *  and MACH_RCV_TIMEOUT options.

 *
 * VM_FLAGS_ANYWHERE
 *	Allocate new VM region anywhere it would fit in the address space.
 *
 * VM_FLAGS_PURGABLE
 *	Create a purgable VM object for that new VM region.
 *
 * VM_FLAGS_4GB_CHUNK
 *	The new VM region will be chunked up into 4GB sized pieces.
 *
 * VM_FLAGS_NO_PMAP_CHECK
 *	(for DEBUG kernel config only, ignored for other configs)
 *	Do not check that there is no stale pmap mapping for the new VM region.
 *	This is useful for kernel memory allocations at bootstrap when building
 *	the initial kernel address space while some memory is already in use.
 *
 * VM_FLAGS_OVERWRITE
 *	The new VM region can replace existing VM regions if necessary
 *	(to be used in combination with VM_FLAGS_FIXED).
 *
 * VM_FLAGS_NO_CACHE
 *	Pages brought in to this VM region are placed on the speculative
 *	queue instead of the active queue.  In other words, they are not
 *	cached so that they will be stolen first if memory runs low.

 * NeXT used to consider 68030 code as generic 68000 code.  For
 * backwards compatability:
 *
 *	CPU_SUBTYPE_MC68030 symbol has been preserved for source code
 *	compatability.
 *
 *	CPU_SUBTYPE_MC680x0_ALL has been defined to be the same
 *	subtype as CPU_SUBTYPE_MC68030 for binary comatability.
 *
 *	CPU_SUBTYPE_MC68030_ONLY has been added to allow new object
 *	files to be tagged as containing 68030-specific instructions.
 *//*
 *	VAX subtypes (these do *not* necessary conform to the actual cpu
 *	ID assigned by DEC available via the SID register).
 *//*
 *     Machine threadtypes.
 *     This is none - not defined - for most machine types/subtypes.
 *//*
 *	Object files that are hand-crafted to run on any
 *	implementation of an architecture are tagged with
 *	CPU_SUBTYPE_MULTIPLE.  This functions essentially the same as
 *	the "ALL" subtype of an architecture except that it allows us
 *	to easily find object files that may need to be modified
 *	whenever a new implementation of an architecture comes out.
 *
 *	It is the responsibility of the implementor to make sure the
 *	software handles unsupported implementations elegantly.
 *//*
 *      When selecting a slice, ANY will pick the slice with the best
 *      grading for the selected cpu_type_t, unlike the "ALL" subtypes,
 *      which are the slices that can run on any hardware for that cpu type.
 *//* pointer authentication with versioned ABI *//* 64 bit libraries *//* mask for feature flags *//*
 * Capability bits used in the definition of cpu_subtype.
 *//*

 *	dependent directory, so that any program can get all definitions
 *	regardless of where is it compiled).

 * Another invalid protection value to support specifying different

 *//*
 * Another invalid protection value to support execute-only protection.
 * VM_PROT_STRIP_READ is a special marker that tells mprotect to not
 * set VM_PROT_READ. We have to do it this way because existing code
 * expects the system to set VM_PROT_READ if VM_PROT_EXECUTE is set.
 * VM_PROT_EXECUTE_ONLY is just a convenience value to indicate that

 *	Another invalid protection value.
 *	Used only by memory_object_data_request upon an object
 *	which has specified a copy_call copy strategy. It is used
 *	when the kernel wants a page belonging to a copy of the

 *//*
 *      When a caller finds that he cannot obtain write permission on a

 *//* Physical page number *//*
 * To minimize the use of 64-bit fields, we keep some physical
 * addresses (that are page aligned) as 32-bit page numbers.
 * This limits the physical address space to 16TB of RAM.
 *//*
 * We use reg64_t for addresses that are 32 bits on a 32-bit
 * machine, and 64 bits on a 64-bit machine, but are always
 * passed and returned in a single GPR on PPC.  This type
 * cannot be used in generic 32-bit c, since on a 64-bit
 * machine the upper half of the register will be ignored
 * by the c compiler in 32-bit mode.  In c, we can only use the
 * type in prototypes of functions that are written in and called
 * from assembly language.  This type is basically a comment.
 *//* Basic effective address *//*
 * We use addr64_t for 64-bit addresses that are used on both
 * 32 and 64-bit machines.  On PPC, they are passed and returned as
 * two adjacent 32-bit GPRs.  We use addr64_t in places where
 * common code must be useable both on 32 and 64-bit machines.

 * The verbs used to create/morph a voucher attribute value.
 * We define some system-wide commands here - related to creation, and transport of
 * vouchers and attributes.  Additional commands can be defined by, and supported by,
 * individual attribute resource managers.
 *//*
 * mach_voucher_attr_command_t - The private verbs implemented by each voucher
 * attribute manager via mach_voucher_attr_command().
 *//*
 * mach_voucher_attr_content_t
 *
 * Data passed to a resource manager for modifying an attribute
 * value or returned from the resource manager in response to a
 * request to externalize the current value for that attribute.
 *//* other well-known-keys will be added here *//*
 * mach_voucher_attr_key_t - The key used to identify a particular managed resource or
 * to select the specific resource managers data associated
 * with a given voucher.
 *//*
 * mach_voucher_selector_t - A means of specifying which thread/task value to extract -
 *  the current voucher set at this level, or a voucher representing
 * the full [layered] effective value for the task/thread.
 *//*
 * This type changes appearance between user-space and kernel.  It is
 * a port at user-space and a reference to an ipc_voucher structure in-kernel.
 *//*
 * Mach Voucher - an immutable collection of attribute value handles.
 *
 * The mach voucher is such that it can be passed between processes
 * as a Mach port send right (by convention in the mach_msg_header_ts
 * msgh_voucher field).
 *
 * You may construct a new mach voucher by passing a construction
 * recipe to host_create_mach_voucher().  The construction recipe supports
 * generic commands for copying, removing, and redeeming attribute value
 * handles from previous vouchers, or running attribute-mananger-specific
 * commands within the recipe.
 *
 * Once the set of attribute value handles is constructed and returned,
 * that set will not change for the life of the voucher (just because the
 * attribute value handle itself doesn't change, the value the handle refers
 * to is free to change at will).

 * role: Enumerated as follows:
 *
 * TASK_UNSPECIFIED is the default, since the role is not
 * inherited from the parent.
 *
 * TASK_FOREGROUND_APPLICATION should be assigned when the
 * task is a normal UI application in the foreground from
 * the HI point of view.
 * **N.B. There may be more than one of these at a given time.
 *
 * TASK_BACKGROUND_APPLICATION should be assigned when the
 * task is a normal UI application in the background from
 * the HI point of view.
 *
 * TASK_CONTROL_APPLICATION should be assigned to the unique
 * UI application which implements the pop-up application dialog.
 * There can only be one task at a time with this designation,
 * which is assigned FCFS.
 *
 * TASK_GRAPHICS_SERVER should be assigned to the graphics
 * management (window) server.  There can only be one task at
 * a time with this designation, which is assigned FCFS.

 * 2) if unasserted on the way in, the current settings are
 * desired and if still unasserted on return, then the info

 * 'get_default' returns asserted, it means that there are no
 * current settings due to other parameters taking precedence,

 * THREAD_BACKGROUND_POLICY:
 *//*
 * THREAD_AFFINITY_POLICY:
 *
 * This policy is experimental.
 * This may be used to express affinity relationships
 * between threads in the task. Threads with the same affinity tag will
 * be scheduled to share an L2 cache if possible. That is, affinity tags
 * are a hint to the scheduler for thread placement.
 *
 * The namespace of affinity tags is generally local to one task. However,
 * a child task created after the assignment of affinity tags by its parent
 * will share that namespace. In particular, a family of forked processes
 * may be created with a shared affinity namespace.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * tag: The affinity set identifier.
 *//*
 * THREAD_PRECEDENCE_POLICY:
 *
 * This may be used to indicate the relative value of the
 * computation compared to the other threads in the task.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 * importance: The importance is specified as a signed value.
 *//*
 * THREAD_TIME_CONSTRAINT_POLICY:
 *
 * This scheduling mode is for threads which have real time
 * constraints on their execution.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 * period: This is the nominal amount of time between separate
 * processing arrivals, specified in absolute time units.  A
 * value of 0 indicates that there is no inherent periodicity in
 * the computation.
 *
 * computation: This is the nominal amount of computation
 * time needed during a separate processing arrival, specified
 * in absolute time units.  The thread may be preempted after
 * the computation time has elapsed.
 * If (computation < constraint/2) it will be forced to
 * constraint/2 to avoid unintended preemption and associated
 * timer interrupts.
 *
 * constraint: This is the maximum amount of real time that
 * may elapse from the start of a separate processing arrival
 * to the end of computation for logically correct functioning,
 * specified in absolute time units.  Must be (>= computation).
 * Note that latency = (constraint - computation).
 *
 * preemptible: IGNORED (This indicates that the computation may be
 * interrupted, subject to the constraint specified above.)
 *//*
 * THREAD_EXTENDED_POLICY:
 *
 * Extended form of THREAD_STANDARD_POLICY, which supplies a
 * hint indicating whether this is a long running computation.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 * timeshare: TRUE (the default) results in identical scheduling
 * behavior as THREAD_STANDARD_POLICY.
 *//*
 * THREAD_STANDARD_POLICY:
 *
 * This is the standard (fair) scheduling mode, assigned to new
 * threads.  The thread will be given processor time in a manner
 * which apportions approximately equal share to long running
 * computations.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	[none]

 * These are the calls for accessing the policy parameters

 *
 * The extra 'get_default' parameter to the second call is
 * IN/OUT as follows:
 * 1) if asserted on the way in it indicates that the default
 * values should be returned, not the ones currently set, in
 * this case 'get_default' will always be asserted on return;
 * 2) if unasserted on the way in, the current settings are
 * desired and if still unasserted on return, then the info
 * returned reflects the current settings, otherwise if
 * 'get_default' returns asserted, it means that there are no
 * current settings due to other parameters taking precedence,
 * and the default ones are being returned instead.

 * The user supplies a nesting level on the call.  When a walk of the
 * user's map is done and a submap is encountered, the nesting count is
 * checked. If the nesting count is greater than 1 the submap is entered and
 * the offset relative to the address in the base map is examined.  If the
 * nesting count is zero, the information on the submap is returned.
 * The caller may thus learn about a submap and its contents by judicious
 * choice of the base map address and nesting count.  The nesting count
 * allows penetration of recursively mapped submaps.  If a submap is
 * encountered as a mapped entry of another submap, the caller may bump
 * the nesting count and call vm_region_recurse again on the target address
 * range.  The "is_submap" field tells the caller whether or not a submap
 * has been encountered.
 *
 * Object only fields are filled in through a walking of the object shadow
 * chain (where one is present), and a walking of the resident page queue.
 *
 *//*
 * For submap info,  the SM flags above are overlayed when a submap
 * is encountered.  The field denotes whether or not machine level mapping
 * information is being shared.  PTE's etc.  When such sharing is taking
 * place the value returned is SM_TRUESHARED otherwise SM_PRIVATE is passed
 * back.
 *//* too small for a real offset *//*
 * This is the legacy basic info structure.  It is
 * deprecated because it passes only a 32-bit memory object
 * offset back - too small for many larger objects (e.g. files).

           This comparison is a bit rough and too strict. Since the input
           parameters can be specified in numerous ways and still end up the
           same it would take a lot of processing to make it really accurate.
           Instead, this matching will assume that re-uses of bound connections
           will most likely also re-use the exact same binding parameters and
           missing out a few edge cases shouldn't hurt anyone very much.

     with web-safe characters.  uri is already percent encoded.  nc is 8 hex
     characters.  algorithm and qop with standard values only contain web-safe
     characters.
  *//* convert on non-ASCII machines *//* We don't support auth-int for PUT or POST at the moment.
       TODO: replace hash of empty string with entity-body for PUT/POST *//*
    If the "qop" directive's value is "auth" or is unspecified, then A2 is:

      A2 = Method ":" digest-uri-value

    If the "qop" value is "auth-int", then A2 is:

      A2 = Method ":" digest-uri-value ":" H(entity-body)

    (The "Method" value is the HTTP request method as specified in section
    5.1.1 of RFC 2616)
  *//* Convert on non-ASCII machines *//* nonce and cnonce are OUTSIDE the hash *//*
    If the algorithm is "MD5" or unspecified (which then defaults to MD5):

      A1 = unq(username-value) ":" unq(realm-value) ":" passwd

    If the algorithm is "MD5-sess" then:

      A1 = H(unq(username-value) ":" unq(realm-value) ":" passwd) ":"
           unq(nonce-value) ":" unq(cnonce-value)

 * returns TRUE if the key could be found, FALSE if it does not exists
 *//* Calculate size needed *//* null terminator *//* Perform quoted-string escaping as described in RFC2616 and its errata *//* 65 bytes *//* 32 bytes *//* Convert sha256 chunk to RFC7616 -suitable ascii string*//* 33 bytes *//* Convert md5 chunk to RFC2617 (section 3.1.3) -suitable ascii string*//* end of string *//* the end *//* This signals the end of the content if we didn't get a starting
           quote and then we do "sloppy" parsing *//* Even though this is an escape character, we still
                              store it as-is in the target buffer *//* possibly the start of an escaped quote *//* This starts with a quote so it must end with one as well! *//* eek, no match *//* The CURL_OUTPUT_DIGEST_CONV macro below is for non-ASCII machines.
   It converts digest text to ASCII so the MD5 will be correct for
   what ultimately goes over the network.

  NTLM message structure notes:

  A 'short' is a 'network short', a little-endian 16-bit unsigned value.

  A 'long' is a 'network long', a little-endian, 32-bit unsigned value.

  A 'security buffer' represents a triplet used to point to a buffer,
  consisting of two shorts and one long:

    1. A 'short' containing the length of the buffer content in bytes.
    2. A 'short' containing the allocated space for the buffer in bytes.
    3. A 'long' containing the offset to the start of the buffer in bytes,
       from the beginning of the NTLM message.
*//*
 * ntlm_decode_type2_target()

ZEXTERN uLong ZEXPORT crc32_combine OF((uLong crc1, uLong crc2, z_off_t len2));

     Combine two CRC-32 check values into one.  For two sequences of bytes,
   seq1 and seq2 with lengths len1 and len2, CRC-32 check values were
   calculated for each, crc1 and crc2.  crc32_combine() returns the CRC-32
   check value of seq1 and seq2 concatenated, requiring only crc1, crc2, and
   len2.
*//*
     Same as crc32(), but with a size_t length.
*//*
     Update a running CRC-32 with the bytes buf[0..len-1] and return the
   updated CRC-32.  If buf is Z_NULL, this function returns the required
   initial value for the crc.  Pre- and post-conditioning (one's complement) is
   performed within this function so it shouldn't be done by the application.

   Usage example:

     uLong crc = crc32(0L, Z_NULL, 0);

     while (read_buffer(buffer, length) != EOF) {
       crc = crc32(crc, buffer, length);
     }
     if (crc != original_crc) error();
*//*
ZEXTERN uLong ZEXPORT adler32_combine OF((uLong adler1, uLong adler2,
                                          z_off_t len2));

     Combine two Adler-32 checksums into one.  For two sequences of bytes, seq1
   and seq2 with lengths len1 and len2, Adler-32 checksums were calculated for
   each, adler1 and adler2.  adler32_combine() returns the Adler-32 checksum of
   seq1 and seq2 concatenated, requiring only adler1, adler2, and len2.  Note
   that the z_off_t type (like off_t) is a signed integer.  If len2 is
   negative, the result has no meaning or utility.
*//*
     Same as adler32(), but with a size_t length.
*//*
     Update a running Adler-32 checksum with the bytes buf[0..len-1] and
   return the updated checksum.  If buf is Z_NULL, this function returns the
   required initial value for the checksum.

     An Adler-32 checksum is almost as reliable as a CRC-32 but can be computed
   much faster.

   Usage example:

     uLong adler = adler32(0L, Z_NULL, 0);

     while (read_buffer(buffer, length) != EOF) {
       adler = adler32(adler, buffer, length);
     }
     if (adler != original_adler) error();
*//*
     These functions are not related to compression but are exported
   anyway because they might be useful in applications using the compression
   library.
*//* checksum functions *//*
     Clears the error and end-of-file flags for file.  This is analogous to the
   clearerr() function in stdio.  This is useful for continuing to read a gzip
   file that is being written concurrently.
*//*
     Returns the error message for the last error which occurred on the given
   compressed file.  errnum is set to zlib error number.  If an error occurred
   in the file system and not in the compression library, errnum is set to
   Z_ERRNO and the application may consult errno to get the exact error code.

     The application must not modify the returned string.  Future calls to
   this function may invalidate the previously returned string.  If file is
   closed, then the string previously returned by gzerror will no longer be
   available.

     gzerror() should be used to distinguish errors from end-of-file for those
   functions above that do not distinguish those cases in their return values.
*//*
     Same as gzclose(), but gzclose_r() is only for use when reading, and
   gzclose_w() is only for use when writing or appending.  The advantage to
   using these instead of gzclose() is that they avoid linking in zlib
   compression or decompression code that is not used when only reading or only
   writing respectively.  If gzclose() is used, then both compression and
   decompression code will be included the application when linking to a static
   zlib library.

   Because Mac OS X doesn't use a static zlib library, these routine are of
   no value for Mac OS X-only applications, and gzclose() is recommended
   instead.
*//*
     Flushes all pending output if necessary, closes the compressed file and
   deallocates the (de)compression state.  Note that once file is closed, you
   cannot call gzerror with file, since its structures have been deallocated.
   gzclose must not be called more than once on the same file, just as free
   must not be called more than once on the same allocation.

     gzclose will return Z_STREAM_ERROR if file is not valid, Z_ERRNO on a
   file operation error, Z_MEM_ERROR if out of memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if the
   last read ended in the middle of a gzip stream, or Z_OK on success.
*//*
     Returns true (1) if file is being copied directly while reading, or false
   (0) if file is a gzip stream being decompressed.

     If the input file is empty, gzdirect() will return true, since the input
   does not contain a gzip stream.

     If gzdirect() is used immediately after gzopen() or gzdopen() it will
   cause buffers to be allocated to allow reading the file to determine if it
   is a gzip file.  Therefore if gzbuffer() is used, it should be called before
   gzdirect().

     When writing, gzdirect() returns true (1) if transparent writing was
   requested ("wT" for the gzopen() mode), or false (0) otherwise.  (Note:
   gzdirect() is not needed when writing.  Transparent writing must be
   explicitly requested, so the application already knows the answer.  When
   linking statically, using gzdirect() will include all of the zlib code for
   gzip file reading and decompression, which may not be desired.)
*//*
     Returns true (1) if the end-of-file indicator has been set while reading,
   false (0) otherwise.  Note that the end-of-file indicator is set only if the
   read tried to go past the end of the input, but came up short.  Therefore,
   just like feof(), gzeof() may return false even if there is no more data to
   read, in the event that the last read request was for the exact number of
   bytes remaining in the input file.  This will happen if the input file size
   is an exact multiple of the buffer size.

     If gzeof() returns true, then the read functions will return no more data,
   unless the end-of-file indicator is reset by gzclearerr() and the input file
   has grown since the previous end of file was detected.
*//*
ZEXTERN z_off_t ZEXPORT gzoffset OF((gzFile file));

     Returns the current offset in the file being read or written.  This offset
   includes the count of bytes that precede the gzip stream, for example when
   appending or when using gzdopen() for reading.  When reading, the offset
   does not include as yet unused buffered input.  This information can be used
   for a progress indicator.  On error, gzoffset() returns -1.
*//*
ZEXTERN z_off_t ZEXPORT    gztell OF((gzFile file));

     Returns the starting position for the next gzread or gzwrite on the given
   compressed file.  This position represents a number of bytes in the
   uncompressed data stream, and is zero when starting, even if appending or
   reading a gzip stream from the middle of a file using gzdopen().

     gztell(file) is equivalent to gzseek(file, 0L, SEEK_CUR)
*//*
     Rewinds the given file. This function is supported only for reading.

     gzrewind(file) is equivalent to (int)gzseek(file, 0L, SEEK_SET)
*//*
ZEXTERN z_off_t ZEXPORT gzseek OF((gzFile file,
                                   z_off_t offset, int whence));

     Sets the starting position for the next gzread or gzwrite on the given
   compressed file.  The offset represents a number of bytes in the
   uncompressed data stream.  The whence parameter is defined as in lseek(2);
   the value SEEK_END is not supported.

     If the file is opened for reading, this function is emulated but can be
   extremely slow.  If the file is opened for writing, only forward seeks are
   supported; gzseek then compresses a sequence of zeroes up to the new
   starting position.

     gzseek returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from
   the beginning of the uncompressed stream, or -1 in case of error, in
   particular if the file is opened for writing and the new starting position
   would be before the current position.
*//*
     Flushes all pending output into the compressed file.  The parameter flush
   is as in the deflate() function.  The return value is the zlib error number
   (see function gzerror below).  gzflush is only permitted when writing.

     If the flush parameter is Z_FINISH, the remaining data is written and the
   gzip stream is completed in the output.  If gzwrite() is called again, a new
   gzip stream will be started in the output.  gzread() is able to read such
   concatenated gzip streams.

     gzflush should be called only when strictly necessary because it will
   degrade compression if called too often.
*//*
     Push one character back onto the stream to be read as the first character
   on the next read.  At least one character of push-back is allowed.
   gzungetc() returns the character pushed, or -1 on failure.  gzungetc() will
   fail if c is -1, and may fail if a character has been pushed but not read
   yet.  If gzungetc is used immediately after gzopen or gzdopen, at least the
   output buffer size of pushed characters is allowed.  (See gzbuffer above.)
   The pushed character will be discarded if the stream is repositioned with
   gzseek() or gzrewind().
*//*
     Reads one byte from the compressed file.  gzgetc returns this byte or -1
   in case of end of file or error.  This is implemented as a macro for speed.
   As such, it does not do all of the checking the other functions do.  I.e.
   it does not check to see if file is NULL, nor whether the structure file
   points to has been clobbered or not.
*//*
     Writes c, converted to an unsigned char, into the compressed file.  gzputc
   returns the value that was written, or -1 in case of error.
*//*
     Reads bytes from the compressed file until len-1 characters are read, or a
   newline character is read and transferred to buf, or an end-of-file
   condition is encountered.  If any characters are read or if len == 1, the
   string is terminated with a null character.  If no characters are read due
   to an end-of-file or len < 1, then the buffer is left untouched.

     gzgets returns buf which is a null-terminated string, or it returns NULL
   for end-of-file or in case of error.  If there was an error, the contents at
   buf are indeterminate.
*//*
     Writes the given null-terminated string to the compressed file, excluding
   the terminating null character.

     gzputs returns the number of characters written, or -1 in case of error.
*//*
     Converts, formats, and writes the arguments to the compressed file under
   control of the format string, as in fprintf.  gzprintf returns the number of
   uncompressed bytes actually written, or a negative zlib error code in case
   of error.  The number of uncompressed bytes written is limited to 8191, or
   one less than the buffer size given to gzbuffer().  The caller should assure
   that this limit is not exceeded.  If it is exceeded, then gzprintf() will
   return an error (0) with nothing written.  In this case, there may also be a
   buffer overflow with unpredictable consequences, which is possible only if
   zlib was compiled with the insecure functions sprintf() or vsprintf()
   because the secure snprintf() or vsnprintf() functions were not available.
   This can be determined using zlibCompileFlags().
*//*
     gzfwrite() writes nitems items of size size from buf to file, duplicating
   the interface of stdio's fwrite(), with size_t request and return types.  If
   the library defines size_t, then z_size_t is identical to size_t.  If not,
   then z_size_t is an unsigned integer type that can contain a pointer.

     gzfwrite() returns the number of full items written of size size, or zero
   if there was an error.  If the multiplication of size and nitems overflows,
   i.e. the product does not fit in a z_size_t, then nothing is written, zero
   is returned, and the error state is set to Z_STREAM_ERROR.
*//*
     Writes the given number of uncompressed bytes into the compressed file.
   gzwrite returns the number of uncompressed bytes written or 0 in case of
   error.
*//*
     Read up to nitems items of size size from file to buf, otherwise operating
   as gzread() does.  This duplicates the interface of stdio's fread(), with
   size_t request and return types.  If the library defines size_t, then
   z_size_t is identical to size_t.  If not, then z_size_t is an unsigned
   integer type that can contain a pointer.

     gzfread() returns the number of full items read of size size, or zero if
   the end of the file was reached and a full item could not be read, or if
   there was an error.  gzerror() must be consulted if zero is returned in
   order to determine if there was an error.  If the multiplication of size and
   nitems overflows, i.e. the product does not fit in a z_size_t, then nothing
   is read, zero is returned, and the error state is set to Z_STREAM_ERROR.

     In the event that the end of file is reached and only a partial item is
   available at the end, i.e. the remaining uncompressed data length is not a
   multiple of size, then the final partial item is nevetheless read into buf
   and the end-of-file flag is set.  The length of the partial item read is not
   provided, but could be inferred from the result of gztell().  This behavior
   is the same as the behavior of fread() implementations in common libraries,
   but it prevents the direct use of gzfread() to read a concurrently written
   file, reseting and retrying on end-of-file, when size is not 1.
*//*
     Reads the given number of uncompressed bytes from the compressed file.  If
   the input file is not in gzip format, gzread copies the given number of
   bytes into the buffer directly from the file.

     After reaching the end of a gzip stream in the input, gzread will continue
   to read, looking for another gzip stream.  Any number of gzip streams may be
   concatenated in the input file, and will all be decompressed by gzread().
   If something other than a gzip stream is encountered after a gzip stream,
   that remaining trailing garbage is ignored (and no error is returned).

     gzread can be used to read a gzip file that is being concurrently written.
   Upon reaching the end of the input, gzread will return with the available
   data.  If the error code returned by gzerror is Z_OK or Z_BUF_ERROR, then
   gzclearerr can be used to clear the end of file indicator in order to permit
   gzread to be tried again.  Z_OK indicates that a gzip stream was completed
   on the last gzread.  Z_BUF_ERROR indicates that the input file ended in the
   middle of a gzip stream.  Note that gzread does not return -1 in the event
   of an incomplete gzip stream.  This error is deferred until gzclose(), which
   will return Z_BUF_ERROR if the last gzread ended in the middle of a gzip
   stream.  Alternatively, gzerror can be used before gzclose to detect this
   case.

     gzread returns the number of uncompressed bytes actually read, less than
   len for end of file, or -1 for error.  If len is too large to fit in an int,
   then nothing is read, -1 is returned, and the error state is set to
   Z_STREAM_ERROR.
*//*
     Dynamically update the compression level or strategy.  See the description
   of deflateInit2 for the meaning of these parameters.  Previously provided
   data is flushed before the parameter change.

     gzsetparams returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the file was not
   opened for writing, Z_ERRNO if there is an error writing the flushed data,
   or Z_MEM_ERROR if there is a memory allocation error.
*//*
     Set the internal buffer size used by this library's functions.  The
   default buffer size is 8192 bytes.  This function must be called after
   gzopen() or gzdopen(), and before any other calls that read or write the
   file.  The buffer memory allocation is always deferred to the first read or
   write.  Three times that size in buffer space is allocated.  A larger buffer
   size of, for example, 64K or 128K bytes will noticeably increase the speed
   of decompression (reading).

     The new buffer size also affects the maximum length for gzprintf().

     gzbuffer() returns 0 on success, or -1 on failure, such as being called
   too late.
*//*
     gzdopen associates a gzFile with the file descriptor fd.  File descriptors
   are obtained from calls like open, dup, creat, pipe or fileno (if the file
   has been previously opened with fopen).  The mode parameter is as in gzopen.

     The next call of gzclose on the returned gzFile will also close the file
   descriptor fd, just like fclose(fdopen(fd, mode)) closes the file descriptor
   fd.  If you want to keep fd open, use fd = dup(fd_keep); gz = gzdopen(fd,
   mode);.  The duplicated descriptor should be saved to avoid a leak, since
   gzdopen does not close fd if it fails.  If you are using fileno() to get the
   file descriptor from a FILE *, then you will have to use dup() to avoid
   double-close()ing the file descriptor.  Both gzclose() and fclose() will
   close the associated file descriptor, so they need to have different file
   descriptors.

     gzdopen returns NULL if there was insufficient memory to allocate the
   gzFile state, if an invalid mode was specified (an 'r', 'w', or 'a' was not
   provided, or '+' was provided), or if fd is -1.  The file descriptor is not
   used until the next gz* read, write, seek, or close operation, so gzdopen
   will not detect if fd is invalid (unless fd is -1).
*//*
ZEXTERN gzFile ZEXPORT gzopen OF((const char *path, const char *mode));

     Opens a gzip (.gz) file for reading or writing.  The mode parameter is as
   in fopen ("rb" or "wb") but can also include a compression level ("wb9") or
   a strategy: 'f' for filtered data as in "wb6f", 'h' for Huffman-only
   compression as in "wb1h", 'R' for run-length encoding as in "wb1R", or 'F'
   for fixed code compression as in "wb9F".  (See the description of
   deflateInit2 for more information about the strategy parameter.)  'T' will
   request transparent writing or appending with no compression and not using
   the gzip format.

     "a" can be used instead of "w" to request that the gzip stream that will
   be written be appended to the file.  "+" will result in an error, since
   reading and writing to the same gzip file is not supported.  The addition of
   "x" when writing will create the file exclusively, which fails if the file
   already exists.  On systems that support it, the addition of "e" when
   reading or writing will set the flag to close the file on an execve() call.

     These functions, as well as gzip, will read and decode a sequence of gzip
   streams in a file.  The append function of gzopen() can be used to create
   such a file.  (Also see gzflush() for another way to do this.)  When
   appending, gzopen does not test whether the file begins with a gzip stream,
   nor does it look for the end of the gzip streams to begin appending.  gzopen
   will simply append a gzip stream to the existing file.

     gzopen can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this
   case gzread will directly read from the file without decompression.  When
   reading, this will be detected automatically by looking for the magic two-
   byte gzip header.

     gzopen returns NULL if the file could not be opened, if there was
   insufficient memory to allocate the gzFile state, or if an invalid mode was
   specified (an 'r', 'w', or 'a' was not provided, or '+' was provided).
   errno can be checked to determine if the reason gzopen failed was that the
   file could not be opened.
*//* semi-opaque gzip file descriptor *//*
     This library supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format with
   an interface similar to that of stdio, using the functions that start with
   "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a gzip
   wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.
*//* gzip file access functions *//*
     Same as uncompress, except that sourceLen is a pointer, where the
   length of the source is *sourceLen.  On return, *sourceLen is the number of
   source bytes consumed.
*//*
     Decompresses the source buffer into the destination buffer.  sourceLen is
   the byte length of the source buffer.  Upon entry, destLen is the total size
   of the destination buffer, which must be large enough to hold the entire
   uncompressed data.  (The size of the uncompressed data must have been saved
   previously by the compressor and transmitted to the decompressor by some
   mechanism outside the scope of this compression library.) Upon exit, destLen
   is the actual size of the uncompressed data.

     uncompress returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if there was not enough room in the output
   buffer, or Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was corrupted or incomplete.  In
   the case where there is not enough room, uncompress() will fill the output
   buffer with the uncompressed data up to that point.
*//*
     compressBound() returns an upper bound on the compressed size after
   compress() or compress2() on sourceLen bytes.  It would be used before a
   compress() or compress2() call to allocate the destination buffer.
*//*
     Compresses the source buffer into the destination buffer.  The level
   parameter has the same meaning as in deflateInit.  sourceLen is the byte
   length of the source buffer.  Upon entry, destLen is the total size of the
   destination buffer, which must be at least the value returned by
   compressBound(sourceLen).  Upon exit, destLen is the actual size of the
   compressed data.

     compress2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if there was not enough room in the output buffer,
   Z_STREAM_ERROR if the level parameter is invalid.
*//*
     Compresses the source buffer into the destination buffer.  sourceLen is
   the byte length of the source buffer.  Upon entry, destLen is the total size
   of the destination buffer, which must be at least the value returned by
   compressBound(sourceLen).  Upon exit, destLen is the actual size of the
   compressed data.  compress() is equivalent to compress2() with a level
   parameter of Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION.

     compress returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if there was not enough room in the output
   buffer.

     The following utility functions are implemented on top of the basic

   you need special options.

     All memory allocated by inflateBackInit() is freed.

     inflateBackEnd() returns Z_OK on success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream
   state was inconsistent.
*//*
     inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back
   interface for input and output.  This is potentially more efficient than
   inflate() for file i/o applications, in that it avoids copying between the
   output and the sliding window by simply making the window itself the output
   buffer.  inflate() can be faster on modern CPUs when used with large
   buffers.  inflateBack() trusts the application to not change the output
   buffer passed by the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns.

     inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state
   and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer.
   inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw
   deflate stream with each call.  inflateBackEnd() is then called to free the
   allocated state.

     A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer.
   This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip
   files and writes out uncompressed files.  The utility would decode the
   header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only
   the raw deflate stream to decompress.  This is different from the default
   behavior of inflate(), which expects a zlib header and trailer around the
   deflate stream.

     inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then
   called by inflateBack() for input and output.  inflateBack() calls those
   routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the
   uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error.  The function's
   parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func
   typedefs.  inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the
   number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf.  If
   there is no input available, in() must return zero -- buf is ignored in that
   case -- and inflateBack() will return a buffer error.  inflateBack() will
   call out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len-1].
   out() should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure.  If out()
   returns non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error.  Neither in() nor
   out() are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to
   inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from.
   The length written by out() will be at most the window size.  Any non-zero
   amount of input may be provided by in().

     For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by
   setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in.  If that input is exhausted, then
   in() will be called.  Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before
   calling inflateBack().  If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called
   immediately for input.  If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in
   must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will
   initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 ..  strm->avail_in - 1].

     The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the
   first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called.  These
   descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller-
   supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job.

     On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to
   pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call.  The
   return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR
   if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format error
   in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the nature
   of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly initialized.
   In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be distinguished
   using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned an error.  If
   strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to out() returning
   non-zero.  (in() will always be called before out(), so strm->next_in is
   assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.)  Note that inflateBack()
   cannot return Z_OK.
*//*
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateBackInit OF((z_streamp strm, int windowBits,
                                        unsigned char FAR *window));

     Initialize the internal stream state for decompression using inflateBack()
   calls.  The fields zalloc, zfree and opaque in strm must be initialized
   before the call.  If zalloc and zfree are Z_NULL, then the default library-
   derived memory allocation routines are used.  windowBits is the base two
   logarithm of the window size, in the range 8..15.  window is a caller
   supplied buffer of that size.  Except for special applications where it is
   assured that deflate was used with small window sizes, windowBits must be 15
   and a 32K byte window must be supplied to be able to decompress general
   deflate streams.

     See inflateBack() for the usage of these routines.

     inflateBackInit will return Z_OK on success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any of
   the parameters are invalid, Z_MEM_ERROR if the internal state could not be
   allocated, or Z_VERSION_ERROR if the version of the library does not match
   the version of the header file.
*//*
     inflateGetHeader() requests that gzip header information be stored in the
   provided gz_header structure.  inflateGetHeader() may be called after
   inflateInit2() or inflateReset(), and before the first call of inflate().
   As inflate() processes the gzip stream, head->done is zero until the header
   is completed, at which time head->done is set to one.  If a zlib stream is
   being decoded, then head->done is set to -1 to indicate that there will be
   no gzip header information forthcoming.  Note that Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES can be
   used to force inflate() to return immediately after header processing is
   complete and before any actual data is decompressed.

     The text, time, xflags, and os fields are filled in with the gzip header
   contents.  hcrc is set to true if there is a header CRC.  (The header CRC
   was valid if done is set to one.) If extra is not Z_NULL, then extra_max
   contains the maximum number of bytes to write to extra.  Once done is true,
   extra_len contains the actual extra field length, and extra contains the
   extra field, or that field truncated if extra_max is less than extra_len.
   If name is not Z_NULL, then up to name_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than name_max.  If
   comment is not Z_NULL, then up to comm_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than comm_max.  When any
   of extra, name, or comment are not Z_NULL and the respective field is not
   present in the header, then that field is set to Z_NULL to signal its
   absence.  This allows the use of deflateSetHeader() with the returned
   structure to duplicate the header.  However if those fields are set to
   allocated memory, then the application will need to save those pointers
   elsewhere so that they can be eventually freed.

     If inflateGetHeader is not used, then the header information is simply
   discarded.  The header is always checked for validity, including the header
   CRC if present.  inflateReset() will reset the process to discard the header
   information.  The application would need to call inflateGetHeader() again to
   retrieve the header from the next gzip stream.

     inflateGetHeader returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     This function returns two values, one in the lower 16 bits of the return
   value, and the other in the remaining upper bits, obtained by shifting the
   return value down 16 bits.  If the upper value is -1 and the lower value is
   zero, then inflate() is currently decoding information outside of a block.
   If the upper value is -1 and the lower value is non-zero, then inflate is in
   the middle of a stored block, with the lower value equaling the number of
   bytes from the input remaining to copy.  If the upper value is not -1, then
   it is the number of bits back from the current bit position in the input of
   the code (literal or length/distance pair) currently being processed.  In
   that case the lower value is the number of bytes already emitted for that
   code.

     A code is being processed if inflate is waiting for more input to complete
   decoding of the code, or if it has completed decoding but is waiting for
   more output space to write the literal or match data.

     inflateMark() is used to mark locations in the input data for random
   access, which may be at bit positions, and to note those cases where the
   output of a code may span boundaries of random access blocks.  The current
   location in the input stream can be determined from avail_in and data_type
   as noted in the description for the Z_BLOCK flush parameter for inflate.

     inflateMark returns the value noted above, or -65536 if the provided
   source stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     This function inserts bits in the inflate input stream.  The intent is
   that this function is used to start inflating at a bit position in the
   middle of a byte.  The provided bits will be used before any bytes are used
   from next_in.  This function should only be used with raw inflate, and
   should be used before the first inflate() call after inflateInit2() or
   inflateReset().  bits must be less than or equal to 16, and that many of the
   least significant bits of value will be inserted in the input.

     If bits is negative, then the input stream bit buffer is emptied.  Then
   inflatePrime() can be called again to put bits in the buffer.  This is used
   to clear out bits leftover after feeding inflate a block description prior
   to feeding inflate codes.

     inflatePrime returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     This function is the same as inflateReset, but it also permits changing
   the wrap and window size requests.  The windowBits parameter is interpreted
   the same as it is for inflateInit2.  If the window size is changed, then the
   memory allocated for the window is freed, and the window will be reallocated
   by inflate() if needed.

     inflateReset2 returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent (such as zalloc or state being Z_NULL), or if
   the windowBits parameter is invalid.
*//*
     This function is equivalent to inflateEnd followed by inflateInit,
   but does not free and reallocate the internal decompression state.  The
   stream will keep attributes that may have been set by inflateInit2.

     inflateReset returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent (such as zalloc or state being Z_NULL).
*//*
     Sets the destination stream as a complete copy of the source stream.

     This function can be useful when randomly accessing a large stream.  The
   first pass through the stream can periodically record the inflate state,
   allowing restarting inflate at those points when randomly accessing the
   stream.

     inflateCopy returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source stream state was inconsistent
   (such as zalloc being Z_NULL).  msg is left unchanged in both source and
   destination.
*//*
     Skips invalid compressed data until a possible full flush point (see above
   for the description of deflate with Z_FULL_FLUSH) can be found, or until all
   available input is skipped.  No output is provided.

     inflateSync searches for a 00 00 FF FF pattern in the compressed data.
   All full flush points have this pattern, but not all occurrences of this
   pattern are full flush points.

     inflateSync returns Z_OK if a possible full flush point has been found,
   Z_BUF_ERROR if no more input was provided, Z_DATA_ERROR if no flush point
   has been found, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent.
   In the success case, the application may save the current current value of
   total_in which indicates where valid compressed data was found.  In the
   error case, the application may repeatedly call inflateSync, providing more
   input each time, until success or end of the input data.
*//*
     Returns the sliding dictionary being maintained by inflate.  dictLength is
   set to the number of bytes in the dictionary, and that many bytes are copied
   to dictionary.  dictionary must have enough space, where 32768 bytes is
   always enough.  If inflateGetDictionary() is called with dictionary equal to
   Z_NULL, then only the dictionary length is returned, and nothing is copied.
   Similary, if dictLength is Z_NULL, then it is not set.

     inflateGetDictionary returns Z_OK on success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   stream state is inconsistent.
*//*
     Initializes the decompression dictionary from the given uncompressed byte
   sequence.  This function must be called immediately after a call of inflate,
   if that call returned Z_NEED_DICT.  The dictionary chosen by the compressor
   can be determined from the Adler-32 value returned by that call of inflate.
   The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same dictionary (see
   deflateSetDictionary).  For raw inflate, this function can be called at any
   time to set the dictionary.  If the provided dictionary is smaller than the
   window and there is already data in the window, then the provided dictionary
   will amend what's there.  The application must insure that the dictionary
   that was used for compression is provided.

     inflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (e.g.  dictionary being Z_NULL) or the stream state is
   inconsistent, Z_DATA_ERROR if the given dictionary doesn't match the
   expected one (incorrect Adler-32 value).  inflateSetDictionary does not
   perform any decompression: this will be done by subsequent calls of
   inflate().
*//*
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateInit2 OF((z_streamp strm,
                                     int  windowBits));

     This is another version of inflateInit with an extra parameter.  The
   fields next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized
   before by the caller.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for
   this version of the library.  The default value is 15 if inflateInit is used
   instead.  windowBits must be greater than or equal to the windowBits value
   provided to deflateInit2() while compressing, or it must be equal to 15 if
   deflateInit2() was not used.  If a compressed stream with a larger window
   size is given as input, inflate() will return with the error code
   Z_DATA_ERROR instead of trying to allocate a larger window.

     windowBits can also be zero to request that inflate use the window size in
   the zlib header of the compressed stream.

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate.  In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size.  inflate() will then process raw deflate data,
   not looking for a zlib or gzip header, not generating a check value, and not
   looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream.  This
   is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format
   such as zip.  Those formats provide their own check values.  If a custom
   format is developed using the raw deflate format for compressed data, it is
   recommended that a check value such as an Adler-32 or a CRC-32 be applied to
   the uncompressed data as is done in the zlib, gzip, and zip formats.  For
   most applications, the zlib format should be used as is.  Note that comments
   above on the use in deflateInit2() applies to the magnitude of windowBits.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip decoding.  Add
   32 to windowBits to enable zlib and gzip decoding with automatic header
   detection, or add 16 to decode only the gzip format (the zlib format will
   return a Z_DATA_ERROR).  If a gzip stream is being decoded, strm->adler is a
   CRC-32 instead of an Adler-32.  Unlike the gunzip utility and gzread() (see
   below), inflate() will not automatically decode concatenated gzip streams.
   inflate() will return Z_STREAM_END at the end of the gzip stream.  The state
   would need to be reset to continue decoding a subsequent gzip stream.

     inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the parameters are
   invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure.  msg is set to null if
   there is no error message.  inflateInit2 does not perform any decompression
   apart from possibly reading the zlib header if present: actual decompression
   will be done by inflate().  (So next_in and avail_in may be modified, but
   next_out and avail_out are unused and unchanged.) The current implementation
   of inflateInit2() does not process any header information -- that is
   deferred until inflate() is called.
*//*
     deflateSetHeader() provides gzip header information for when a gzip
   stream is requested by deflateInit2().  deflateSetHeader() may be called
   after deflateInit2() or deflateReset() and before the first call of
   deflate().  The text, time, os, extra field, name, and comment information
   in the provided gz_header structure are written to the gzip header (xflag is
   ignored -- the extra flags are set according to the compression level).  The
   caller must assure that, if not Z_NULL, name and comment are terminated with
   a zero byte, and that if extra is not Z_NULL, that extra_len bytes are
   available there.  If hcrc is true, a gzip header crc is included.  Note that
   the current versions of the command-line version of gzip (up through version
   1.3.x) do not support header crc's, and will report that it is a "multi-part
   gzip file" and give up.

     If deflateSetHeader is not used, the default gzip header has text false,
   the time set to zero, and os set to 255, with no extra, name, or comment
   fields.  The gzip header is returned to the default state by deflateReset().

     deflateSetHeader returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     deflatePrime() inserts bits in the deflate output stream.  The intent
   is that this function is used to start off the deflate output with the bits
   leftover from a previous deflate stream when appending to it.  As such, this
   function can only be used for raw deflate, and must be used before the first
   deflate() call after a deflateInit2() or deflateReset().  bits must be less
   than or equal to 16, and that many of the least significant bits of value
   will be inserted in the output.

     deflatePrime returns Z_OK if success, Z_BUF_ERROR if there was not enough
   room in the internal buffer to insert the bits, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   source stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     deflatePending() returns the number of bytes and bits of output that have
   been generated, but not yet provided in the available output.  The bytes not
   provided would be due to the available output space having being consumed.
   The number of bits of output not provided are between 0 and 7, where they
   await more bits to join them in order to fill out a full byte.  If pending
   or bits are Z_NULL, then those values are not set.

     deflatePending returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.
 *//*
     deflateBound() returns an upper bound on the compressed size after
   deflation of sourceLen bytes.  It must be called after deflateInit() or
   deflateInit2(), and after deflateSetHeader(), if used.  This would be used
   to allocate an output buffer for deflation in a single pass, and so would be
   called before deflate().  If that first deflate() call is provided the
   sourceLen input bytes, an output buffer allocated to the size returned by
   deflateBound(), and the flush value Z_FINISH, then deflate() is guaranteed
   to return Z_STREAM_END.  Note that it is possible for the compressed size to
   be larger than the value returned by deflateBound() if flush options other
   than Z_FINISH or Z_NO_FLUSH are used.
*//*
     Fine tune deflate's internal compression parameters.  This should only be
   used by someone who understands the algorithm used by zlib's deflate for
   searching for the best matching string, and even then only by the most
   fanatic optimizer trying to squeeze out the last compressed bit for their
   specific input data.  Read the deflate.c source code for the meaning of the
   max_lazy, good_length, nice_length, and max_chain parameters.

     deflateTune() can be called after deflateInit() or deflateInit2(), and
   returns Z_OK on success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR for an invalid deflate stream.

     Dynamically update the compression level and compression strategy.  The
   interpretation of level and strategy is as in deflateInit2().  This can be
   used to switch between compression and straight copy of the input data, or
   to switch to a different kind of input data requiring a different strategy.
   If the compression approach (which is a function of the level) or the
   strategy is changed, and if any input has been consumed in a previous
   deflate() call, then the input available so far is compressed with the old
   level and strategy using deflate(strm, Z_BLOCK).  There are three approaches
   for the compression levels 0, 1..3, and 4..9 respectively.  The new level
   and strategy will take effect at the next call of deflate().

     If a deflate(strm, Z_BLOCK) is performed by deflateParams(), and it does
   not have enough output space to complete, then the parameter change will not
   take effect.  In this case, deflateParams() can be called again with the
   same parameters and more output space to try again.

     In order to assure a change in the parameters on the first try, the
   deflate stream should be flushed using deflate() with Z_BLOCK or other flush
   request until strm.avail_out is not zero, before calling deflateParams().
   Then no more input data should be provided before the deflateParams() call.
   If this is done, the old level and strategy will be applied to the data
   compressed before deflateParams(), and the new level and strategy will be
   applied to the the data compressed after deflateParams().

     deflateParams returns Z_OK on success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source stream
   state was inconsistent or if a parameter was invalid, or Z_BUF_ERROR if
   there was not enough output space to complete the compression of the
   available input data before a change in the strategy or approach.  Note that
   in the case of a Z_BUF_ERROR, the parameters are not changed.  A return
   value of Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, in which case deflateParams() can be
   retried with more output space.
*//*
     This function is equivalent to deflateEnd followed by deflateInit, but
   does not free and reallocate the internal compression state.  The stream
   will leave the compression level and any other attributes that may have been
   set unchanged.

     deflateReset returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent (such as zalloc or state being Z_NULL).
*//*
     Sets the destination stream as a complete copy of the source stream.

     This function can be useful when several compression strategies will be
   tried, for example when there are several ways of pre-processing the input
   data with a filter.  The streams that will be discarded should then be freed
   by calling deflateEnd.  Note that deflateCopy duplicates the internal
   compression state which can be quite large, so this strategy is slow and can
   consume lots of memory.

     deflateCopy returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source stream state was inconsistent
   (such as zalloc being Z_NULL).  msg is left unchanged in both source and
   destination.
*//*
     Returns the sliding dictionary being maintained by deflate.  dictLength is
   set to the number of bytes in the dictionary, and that many bytes are copied
   to dictionary.  dictionary must have enough space, where 32768 bytes is
   always enough.  If deflateGetDictionary() is called with dictionary equal to
   Z_NULL, then only the dictionary length is returned, and nothing is copied.
   Similary, if dictLength is Z_NULL, then it is not set.

     deflateGetDictionary() may return a length less than the window size, even
   when more than the window size in input has been provided. It may return up
   to 258 bytes less in that case, due to how zlib's implementation of deflate
   manages the sliding window and lookahead for matches, where matches can be
   up to 258 bytes long. If the application needs the last window-size bytes of
   input, then that would need to be saved by the application outside of zlib.

     deflateGetDictionary returns Z_OK on success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   stream state is inconsistent.
*//*
     Initializes the compression dictionary from the given byte sequence
   without producing any compressed output.  When using the zlib format, this
   function must be called immediately after deflateInit, deflateInit2 or
   deflateReset, and before any call of deflate.  When doing raw deflate, this
   function must be called either before any call of deflate, or immediately
   after the completion of a deflate block, i.e. after all input has been
   consumed and all output has been delivered when using any of the flush
   options Z_BLOCK, Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, or Z_FULL_FLUSH.  The
   compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same dictionary (see
   inflateSetDictionary).

     The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely
   to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly
   used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary.  Using a
   dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be
   predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than
   with the default empty dictionary.

     Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by
   deflateInit or deflateInit2, a part of the dictionary may in effect be
   discarded, for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size
   provided in deflateInit or deflateInit2.  Thus the strings most likely to be
   useful should be put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front.  In
   addition, the current implementation of deflate will use at most the window
   size minus 262 bytes of the provided dictionary.

     Upon return of this function, strm->adler is set to the Adler-32 value
   of the dictionary; the decompressor may later use this value to determine
   which dictionary has been used by the compressor.  (The Adler-32 value
   applies to the whole dictionary even if only a subset of the dictionary is
   actually used by the compressor.) If a raw deflate was requested, then the
   Adler-32 value is not computed and strm->adler is not set.

     deflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (e.g.  dictionary being Z_NULL) or the stream state is
   inconsistent (for example if deflate has already been called for this stream
   or if not at a block boundary for raw deflate).  deflateSetDictionary does
   not perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflateInit2 OF((z_streamp strm,
                                     int  level,
                                     int  method,
                                     int  windowBits,
                                     int  memLevel,
                                     int  strategy));

     This is another version of deflateInit with more compression options.  The
   fields next_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by the
   caller.

     The method parameter is the compression method.  It must be Z_DEFLATED in
   this version of the library.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the window size
   (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for this
   version of the library.  Larger values of this parameter result in better
   compression at the expense of memory usage.  The default value is 15 if
   deflateInit is used instead.

     For the current implementation of deflate(), a windowBits value of 8 (a
   window size of 256 bytes) is not supported.  As a result, a request for 8
   will result in 9 (a 512-byte window).  In that case, providing 8 to
   inflateInit2() will result in an error when the zlib header with 9 is
   checked against the initialization of inflate().  The remedy is to not use 8
   with deflateInit2() with this initialization, or at least in that case use 9
   with inflateInit2().

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw deflate.  In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size.  deflate() will then generate raw deflate data
   with no zlib header or trailer, and will not compute a check value.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip encoding.  Add
   16 to windowBits to write a simple gzip header and trailer around the
   compressed data instead of a zlib wrapper.  The gzip header will have no
   file name, no extra data, no comment, no modification time (set to zero), no
   header crc, and the operating system will be set to the appropriate value,
   if the operating system was determined at compile time.  If a gzip stream is
   being written, strm->adler is a CRC-32 instead of an Adler-32.

     For raw deflate or gzip encoding, a request for a 256-byte window is
   rejected as invalid, since only the zlib header provides a means of
   transmitting the window size to the decompressor.

     The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated
   for the internal compression state.  memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but is
   slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory for
   optimal speed.  The default value is 8.  See zconf.h for total memory usage
   as a function of windowBits and memLevel.

     The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm.  Use the
   value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data produced by a
   filter (or predictor), Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only (no
   string match), or Z_RLE to limit match distances to one (run-length
   encoding).  Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a somewhat
   random distribution.  In this case, the compression algorithm is tuned to
   compress them better.  The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more Huffman
   coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between
   Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY.  Z_RLE is designed to be almost as
   fast as Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY, but give better compression for PNG image data.  The
   strategy parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the
   correctness of the compressed output even if it is not set appropriately.
   Z_FIXED prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes, allowing for a simpler
   decoder for special applications.

     deflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any parameter is invalid (such as an invalid
   method), or Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version (zlib_version) is
   incompatible with the version assumed by the caller (ZLIB_VERSION).  msg is
   set to null if there is no error message.  deflateInit2 does not perform any
   compression: this will be done by deflate().
*//*
    The following functions are needed only in some special applications.
*//* Advanced functions *//*
     All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.
   This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any pending
   output.

     inflateEnd returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state
   was inconsistent.
*//*
    inflate decompresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full.  It may introduce
  some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

  The detailed semantics are as follows.  inflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Decompress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly.  If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), then next_in and avail_in are updated
    accordingly, and processing will resume at this point for the next call of
    inflate().

  - Generate more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  inflate() provides as much output as possible, until there is
    no more input data or no more space in the output buffer (see below about
    the flush parameter).

    Before the call of inflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming more
  output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.  If the
  caller of inflate() does not provide both available input and available
  output space, it is possible that there will be no progress made.  The
  application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for example
  when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each call of
  inflate().  If inflate returns Z_OK and with zero avail_out, it must be
  called again after making room in the output buffer because there might be
  more output pending.

    The flush parameter of inflate() can be Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, Z_FINISH,
  Z_BLOCK, or Z_TREES.  Z_SYNC_FLUSH requests that inflate() flush as much
  output as possible to the output buffer.  Z_BLOCK requests that inflate()
  stop if and when it gets to the next deflate block boundary.  When decoding
  the zlib or gzip format, this will cause inflate() to return immediately
  after the header and before the first block.  When doing a raw inflate,
  inflate() will go ahead and process the first block, and will return when it
  gets to the end of that block, or when it runs out of data.

    The Z_BLOCK option assists in appending to or combining deflate streams.
  To assist in this, on return inflate() always sets strm->data_type to the
  number of unused bits in the last byte taken from strm->next_in, plus 64 if
  inflate() is currently decoding the last block in the deflate stream, plus
  128 if inflate() returned immediately after decoding an end-of-block code or
  decoding the complete header up to just before the first byte of the deflate
  stream.  The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the uncompressed
  data from that block has been written to strm->next_out.  The number of
  unused bits may in general be greater than seven, except when bit 7 of
  data_type is set, in which case the number of unused bits will be less than
  eight.  data_type is set as noted here every time inflate() returns for all
  flush options, and so can be used to determine the amount of currently
  consumed input in bits.

    The Z_TREES option behaves as Z_BLOCK does, but it also returns when the
  end of each deflate block header is reached, before any actual data in that
  block is decoded.  This allows the caller to determine the length of the
  deflate block header for later use in random access within a deflate block.
  256 is added to the value of strm->data_type when inflate() returns
  immediately after reaching the end of the deflate block header.

    inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an
  error.  However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step (a
  single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to Z_FINISH.  In
  this case all pending input is processed and all pending output is flushed;
  avail_out must be large enough to hold all of the uncompressed data for the
  operation to complete.  (The size of the uncompressed data may have been
  saved by the compressor for this purpose.)  The use of Z_FINISH is not
  required to perform an inflation in one step.  However it may be used to
  inform inflate that a faster approach can be used for the single inflate()
  call.  Z_FINISH also informs inflate to not maintain a sliding window if the
  stream completes, which reduces inflate's memory footprint.  If the stream
  does not complete, either because not all of the stream is provided or not
  enough output space is provided, then a sliding window will be allocated and
  inflate() can be called again to continue the operation as if Z_NO_FLUSH had
  been used.

     In this implementation, inflate() always flushes as much output as
  possible to the output buffer, and always uses the faster approach on the
  first call.  So the effects of the flush parameter in this implementation are
  on the return value of inflate() as noted below, when inflate() returns early
  when Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES is used, and when inflate() avoids the allocation of
  memory for a sliding window when Z_FINISH is used.

     If a preset dictionary is needed after this call (see inflateSetDictionary
  below), inflate sets strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of the dictionary
  chosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise it sets
  strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of all output produced so far (that is,
  total_out bytes) and returns Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END or an error code as described
  below.  At the end of the stream, inflate() checks that its computed Adler-32
  checksum is equal to that saved by the compressor and returns Z_STREAM_END
  only if the checksum is correct.

    inflate() can decompress and check either zlib-wrapped or gzip-wrapped
  deflate data.  The header type is detected automatically, if requested when
  initializing with inflateInit2().  Any information contained in the gzip
  header is not retained unless inflateGetHeader() is used.  When processing
  gzip-wrapped deflate data, strm->adler32 is set to the CRC-32 of the output
  produced so far.  The CRC-32 is checked against the gzip trailer, as is the
  uncompressed length, modulo 2^32.

    inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed
  or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the compressed data has
  been reached and all uncompressed output has been produced, Z_NEED_DICT if a
  preset dictionary is needed at this point, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was
  corrupted (input stream not conforming to the zlib format or incorrect check
  value, in which case strm->msg points to a string with a more specific
  error), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent (for example
  next_in or next_out was Z_NULL, or the state was inadvertently written over
  by the application), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory, Z_BUF_ERROR
  if no progress was possible or if there was not enough room in the output
  buffer when Z_FINISH is used.  Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, and
  inflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to
  continue decompressing.  If Z_DATA_ERROR is returned, the application may
  then call inflateSync() to look for a good compression block if a partial
  recovery of the data is to be attempted.
*//*
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateInit OF((z_streamp strm));

     Initializes the internal stream state for decompression.  The fields
   next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by
   the caller.  In the current version of inflate, the provided input is not
   read or consumed.  The allocation of a sliding window will be deferred to
   the first call of inflate (if the decompression does not complete on the
   first call).  If zalloc and zfree are set to Z_NULL, inflateInit updates
   them to use default allocation functions.

     inflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the parameters are
   invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure.  msg is set to null if
   there is no error message.  inflateInit does not perform any decompression.
   Actual decompression will be done by inflate().  So next_in, and avail_in,
   next_out, and avail_out are unused and unchanged.  The current
   implementation of inflateInit() does not process any header information --
   that is deferred until inflate() is called.
*//*
     All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.
   This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any pending
   output.

     deflateEnd returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   stream state was inconsistent, Z_DATA_ERROR if the stream was freed
   prematurely (some input or output was discarded).  In the error case, msg
   may be set but then points to a static string (which must not be
   deallocated).
*//*
    deflate compresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full.  It may introduce
  some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

    The detailed semantics are as follows.  deflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Compress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly.  If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and
    processing will resume at this point for the next call of deflate().

  - Generate more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  This action is forced if the parameter flush is non zero.
    Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter
    should be set only when necessary.  Some output may be provided even if
    flush is zero.

    Before the call of deflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming more
  output, and updating avail_in or avail_out accordingly; avail_out should
  never be zero before the call.  The application can consume the compressed
  output when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full (avail_out
  == 0), or after each call of deflate().  If deflate returns Z_OK and with
  zero avail_out, it must be called again after making room in the output
  buffer because there might be more output pending. See deflatePending(),
  which can be used if desired to determine whether or not there is more ouput
  in that case.

    Normally the parameter flush is set to Z_NO_FLUSH, which allows deflate to
  decide how much data to accumulate before producing output, in order to
  maximize compression.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_SYNC_FLUSH, all pending output is
  flushed to the output buffer and the output is aligned on a byte boundary, so
  that the decompressor can get all input data available so far.  (In
  particular avail_in is zero after the call if enough output space has been
  provided before the call.) Flushing may degrade compression for some
  compression algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary.  This
  completes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty stored block
  that is three bits plus filler bits to the next byte, followed by four bytes
  (00 00 ff ff).

    If flush is set to Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, all pending output is flushed to the
  output buffer, but the output is not aligned to a byte boundary.  All of the
  input data so far will be available to the decompressor, as for Z_SYNC_FLUSH.
  This completes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty fixed
  codes block that is 10 bits long.  This assures that enough bytes are output
  in order for the decompressor to finish the block before the empty fixed
  codes block.

    If flush is set to Z_BLOCK, a deflate block is completed and emitted, as
  for Z_SYNC_FLUSH, but the output is not aligned on a byte boundary, and up to
  seven bits of the current block are held to be written as the next byte after
  the next deflate block is completed.  In this case, the decompressor may not
  be provided enough bits at this point in order to complete decompression of
  the data provided so far to the compressor.  It may need to wait for the next
  block to be emitted.  This is for advanced applications that need to control
  the emission of deflate blocks.

    If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with
  Z_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can
  restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if
  random access is desired.  Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade
  compression.

    If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again
  with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated
  avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero
  avail_out).  In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that
  avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to
  avail_out == 0 on return.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed,
  pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was
  enough output space.  If deflate returns with Z_OK or Z_BUF_ERROR, this
  function must be called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated
  avail_out) but no more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an
  error.  After deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations
  on the stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd.

    Z_FINISH can be used in the first deflate call after deflateInit if all the
  compression is to be done in a single step.  In order to complete in one
  call, avail_out must be at least the value returned by deflateBound (see
  below).  Then deflate is guaranteed to return Z_STREAM_END.  If not enough
  output space is provided, deflate will not return Z_STREAM_END, and it must
  be called again as described above.

    deflate() sets strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of all input read
  so far (that is, total_in bytes).  If a gzip stream is being generated, then
  strm->adler will be the CRC-32 checksum of the input read so far.  (See
  deflateInit2 below.)

    deflate() may update strm->data_type if it can make a good guess about
  the input data type (Z_BINARY or Z_TEXT).  If in doubt, the data is
  considered binary.  This field is only for information purposes and does not
  affect the compression algorithm in any manner.

    deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been
  consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to
  Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example
  if next_in or next_out was Z_NULL or the state was inadvertently written over
  by the application), or Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible (for example
  avail_in or avail_out was zero).  Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, and
  deflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to
  continue compressing.
*//*
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflateInit OF((z_streamp strm, int level));

     Initializes the internal stream state for compression.  The fields
   zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by the caller.  If
   zalloc and zfree are set to Z_NULL, deflateInit updates them to use default
   allocation functions.

     The compression level must be Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION, or between 0 and 9:
   1 gives best speed, 9 gives best compression, 0 gives no compression at all
   (the input data is simply copied a block at a time).  Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION
   requests a default compromise between speed and compression (currently
   equivalent to level 6).

     deflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if level is not a valid compression level, or
   Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version (zlib_version) is incompatible
   with the version assumed by the caller (ZLIB_VERSION).  msg is set to null
   if there is no error message.  deflateInit does not perform any compression:
   this will be done by deflate().
*//* The application can compare zlibVersion and ZLIB_VERSION for consistency.

     The application must update next_in and avail_in when avail_in has dropped
   to zero.  It must update next_out and avail_out when avail_out has dropped
   to zero.  The application must initialize zalloc, zfree and opaque before
   calling the init function.  All other fields are set by the compression
   library and must not be updated by the application.

     The opaque value provided by the application will be passed as the first
   parameter for calls of zalloc and zfree.  This can be useful for custom
   memory management.  The compression library attaches no meaning to the
   opaque value.

     zalloc must return Z_NULL if there is not enough memory for the object.
   If zlib is used in a multi-threaded application, zalloc and zfree must be
   thread safe.  In that case, zlib is thread-safe.  When zalloc and zfree are
   Z_NULL on entry to the initialization function, they are set to internal
   routines that use the standard library functions malloc() and free().

     On 16-bit systems, the functions zalloc and zfree must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this if
   the symbol MAXSEG_64K is defined (see zconf.h).  WARNING: On MSDOS, pointers
   returned by zalloc for objects of exactly 65536 bytes *must* have their
   offset normalized to zero.  The default allocation function provided by this
   library ensures this (see zutil.c).  To reduce memory requirements and avoid
   any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of compression ratio, compile
   the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.h).

     The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or progress
   reports.  After compression, total_in holds the total size of the
   uncompressed data and may be saved for use by the decompressor (particularly
   if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in a single step).

    The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
  This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation)
  but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same stream
  interface.

    Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough,
  or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter
  case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

    The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
  the zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
  around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.

    The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
  with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
  gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

    This library can optionally read and write gzip and raw deflate streams in
  memory as well.

    The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
  and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
  file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
  directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.

    The library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash
  even in the case of corrupted input.

     Now, one could interpret that as "written to the socket," but actually,
     it returns the amount of data that was written to a buffer internal to
     the SSLContextRef instead. So it's possible for SSLWrite() to return
     errSSLWouldBlock and a number of bytes "written" because those bytes were
     encrypted and written to a buffer, not to the socket.

     So if this happens, then we need to keep calling SSLWrite() over and

   In general, you want to build this using the most recent OS SDK, since some
   features require curl to be built against the latest SDK. TLS 1.1 and 1.2

 * When these custom push and pull callbacks fail, GNU TLS checks its own
 * session-specific error variable, and when not set also its own global
 * errno variable, in order to take appropriate action. GNU TLS does not
 * require that the transport is actually a socket. This implies that for
 * Windows builds these callbacks should ideally set the session-specific
 * error variable using function gnutls_transport_set_errno or as a last
 * resort global errno variable using gnutls_transport_set_global_errno,
 * with a transport agnostic error value. This implies that some winsock
 * error translation must take place in these callbacks.

     SSL-implementations. SSL_CTX_set_options() is used to enabled those
     work-arounds. The man page for this option states that SSL_OP_ALL enables
     all the work-arounds and that "It is usually safe to use SSL_OP_ALL to
     enable the bug workaround options if compatibility with somewhat broken
     implementations is desired."

     The "-no_ticket" option was introduced in Openssl0.9.8j. It's a flag to
     disable "rfc4507bis session ticket support".  rfc4507bis was later turned
     into the proper RFC5077 it seems: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077

     The enabled extension concerns the session management. I wonder how often
     libcurl stops a connection and then resumes a TLS session. also, sending
     the session data is some overhead. .I suggest that you just use your
     proposed patch (which explicitly disables TICKET).

     If someone writes an application with libcurl and openssl who wants to
     enable the feature, one can do this in the SSL callback.

     SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG option enabling allowed proper
     interoperability with web server Netscape Enterprise Server 2.0.1 which
     was released back in 1996.

     Due to CVE-2010-4180, option SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG has
     become ineffective as of OpenSSL 0.9.8q and 1.0.0c. In order to mitigate
     CVE-2010-4180 when using previous OpenSSL versions we no longer enable
     this option regardless of OpenSSL version and SSL_OP_ALL definition.

     OpenSSL added a work-around for a SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 CBC vulnerability
     (https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt). In 0.9.6e they added a bit to
     SSL_OP_ALL that _disables_ that work-around despite the fact that
     SSL_OP_ALL is documented to do "rather harmless" workarounds. In order to
     keep the secure work-around, the SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS bit
     must not be set.
  *//* the SSL trace callback is only used for verbose logging *//* it will be handled later with the context options *//* Make funny stuff to get random input *//* convoluted #if condition just to avoid compiler warnings on unused
     variable *//* HAS_NPN *//*
 * in is a list of length prefixed strings. this function has to select
 * the protocol we want to use from the list and write its string into out.
 *//* Check for OpenSSL 1.0.1 which has NPN support. *//* Check for OpenSSL 1.0.2 which has ALPN support. *//* ====================================================== *//* SSLv2 doesn't seem to have TLS record-type headers, so OpenSSL
     * always pass-up content-type as 0. But the interesting message-type
     * is at 'buf[0]'.
     *//* check the upper 8 bits only below *//* the info given when the version is zero is not that useful for us *//* removed in recent versions *//*
 * Our callback from the SSL/TLS layers.
 *//* The SSL_CTRL_SET_MSG_CALLBACK doesn't exist in ancient OpenSSL versions
   and thus this cannot be done there. *//* Find issuer of responder cert and add it to the OCSP response chain *//* First make sure the peer cert chain includes both a peer and an issuer,
     and the OCSP response contains a responder cert. *//* The authorized responder cert in the OCSP response MUST be signed by the
     peer cert's issuer (see RFC6960 section 4.2.2.2). If that's a root cert,
     no problem, but if it's an intermediate cert OpenSSL has a bug where it
     expects this issuer to be present in the chain embedded in the OCSP
     response. So we add it if necessary. *//* Fixed after 1.0.2a *//* error already detected, pass through *//* Curl_convert_from_utf8 calls failf if unsuccessful *//* convert peer_CN from UTF8 *//* there was a terminating zero before the end of string, this
             cannot match and we return failure! *//* not a UTF8 name *//* In OpenSSL 0.9.7d and earlier, ASN1_STRING_to_UTF8 fails if the input
         is already UTF-8 encoded. We check for this case and copy the raw
         string manually to avoid the problem. This code can be made
         conditional in the future when OpenSSL has been fixed. Work-around
         brought by Alexis S. L. Carvalho. *//* we have the name entry and we will now convert this to a string
       that we can use for comparison. Doing this we support BMPstring,
       UTF8 etc. *//* The following is done because of a bug in 0.9.6b *//* we have to look to the last occurrence of a commonName in the
       distinguished one to get the most significant one. *//* an alternative name matched *//* compare alternative IP address if the data chunk is the same size
             our server IP address is *//* IP address comparison *//* if this isn't true, there was an embedded zero in the name
                string and we cannot match it. *//* The OpenSSL man page explicitly says: "In general it cannot be
             assumed that the data returned by ASN1_STRING_data() is null
             terminated or does not contain embedded nulls." But also that
             "The actual format of the data will depend on the actual string
             type itself: for example for and IA5String the data will be ASCII"

             Gisle researched the OpenSSL sources:
             "I checked the 0.9.6 and 0.9.8 sources before my patch and
             it always 0-terminates an IA5String."
          *//* name/pattern comparison *//* get data and length *//* only check alternatives of the same type the target is *//* get a handle to alternative name number i *//* loop through all alternatives - until a dnsmatch *//* get amount of alternatives, RFC2459 claims there MUST be at least
       one, but we don't depend on it... *//* get a "list" of alternative names *//* if a iPAddress field exists in the cert *//* if a dNSName field exists in the cert *//* target type, GEN_DNS or GEN_IPADD *//* Quote from RFC2818 section 3.1 "Server Identity"

   If a subjectAltName extension of type dNSName is present, that MUST
   be used as the identity. Otherwise, the (most specific) Common Name
   field in the Subject field of the certificate MUST be used. Although
   the use of the Common Name is existing practice, it is deprecated and
   Certification Authorities are encouraged to use the dNSName instead.

   Matching is performed using the matching rules specified by
   [RFC2459].  If more than one identity of a given type is present in
   the certificate (e.g., more than one dNSName name, a match in any one
   of the set is considered acceptable.) Names may contain the wildcard
   character * which is considered to match any single domain name
   component or component fragment. E.g., *.a.com matches foo.a.com but
   not bar.foo.a.com. f*.com matches foo.com but not bar.com.

   In some cases, the URI is specified as an IP address rather than a
   hostname. In this case, the iPAddress subjectAltName must be present
   in the certificate and must exactly match the IP in the URI.

*//* Curl_cert_hostcheck uses host encoding, but we get ASCII from
     OpenSSl.
   *//*

     this queue here should be harmless at worst. *//*

   * always be valid. Transfer of decrypted data to the caller's buffer is

   *//* we want the length of the encrypted buffer to be at least large enough

       The return value is the number of unencrypted bytes that were sent. *//* socket is writable *//* send entire message or fail *//*
      It's important to send the full message which includes the header,
      encrypted payload, and trailer.  Until the client receives all the
      data a coherent message has not been delivered and the client
      can't read any of it.

      If we wanted to buffer the unwritten encrypted bytes, we would
      tell the client that all data it has requested to be sent has been
      sent. The unwritten encrypted bytes would be the first bytes to
      send on the next invocation.
      Here's the catch with this - if we tell the client that all the
      bytes have been sent, will the client call this method again to
      send the buffered data?  Looking at who calls this function, it
      seems the answer is NO.

         and therefore begins after the already processed data *//*
        There are two cases where we could be getting extra data here:
        1) If we're renegotiating a connection and the handshake is already
        complete (from the server perspective), it can encrypted app data
        (not handshake data) in an extra buffer at this point.
        2) (sspi_status == SEC_I_CONTINUE_NEEDED) We are negotiating a
        connection and this extra data is part of the handshake.
        We should process the data immediately; waiting for the socket to
        be ready may fail since the server is done sending handshake data.

Flags
-----
SANITIZE_ALLOW_COLONS:     Allow colons.
Without this flag colons are sanitized.

SANITIZE_ALLOW_PATH:       Allow path separators and colons.
Without this flag path separators and colons are sanitized.

SANITIZE_ALLOW_RESERVED:   Allow reserved device names.
Without this flag a reserved device name is renamed (COM1 => _COM1) unless it's
in a UNC prefixed path.

SANITIZE_ALLOW_TRUNCATE:   Allow truncating a long filename.
Without this flag if the sanitized filename or path will be too long an error
occurs. With this flag the filename --and not any other parts of the path-- may
be truncated to at least a single character. A filename followed by an
alternate data stream (ADS) cannot be truncated in any case.

 * Reads a 'name=value' parameter and builds the appropriate linked list.
 *
 * Specify files to upload with 'name=@filename', or 'name=@"filename"'
 * in case the filename contain ',' or ';'. Supports specified
 * given Content-Type of the files. Such as ';type=<content-type>'.
 *
 * If literal_value is set, any initial '@' or '<' in the value string
 * loses its special meaning, as does any embedded ';type='.
 *
 * You may specify more than one file for a single name (field). Specify
 * multiple files by writing it like:
 *
 * 'name=@filename,filename2,filename3'
 *
 * or use double-quotes quote the filename:
 *
 * 'name=@"filename","filename2","filename3"'
 *
 * If you want content-types specified for each too, write them like:
 *
 * 'name=@filename;type=image/gif,filename2,filename3'
 *
 * If you want custom headers added for a single part, write them in a separate
 * file and do like this:
 *
 * 'name=foo;headers=@headerfile' or why not
 * 'name=@filemame;headers=@headerfile'
 *
 * To upload a file, but to fake the file name that will be included in the
 * formpost, do like this:
 *
 * 'name=@filename;filename=/dev/null' or quote the faked filename like:
 * 'name=@filename;filename="play, play, and play.txt"'
 *
 * If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by double-quotes,
 * else curl will fail to figure out the correct filename. if the filename
 * tobe quoted contains '"' or '\', '"' and '\' must be escaped by backslash.
 *
 * This function uses curl_formadd to fulfill it's job. Is heavily based on
 * the old curl_formparse code.
