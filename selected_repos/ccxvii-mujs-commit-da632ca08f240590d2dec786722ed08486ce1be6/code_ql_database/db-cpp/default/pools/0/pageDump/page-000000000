 *//*
 * We intentionally define to nothing pointer attributes which do not have an

 * _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_ONLY_BIT_INODE indicates that the ino_t type may only

 * (and non-zero).  There is no struct stat64 either, as the regular
 * struct stat will already be the 64-bit version.
 *//*
 * _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_BIT_INODE indicates that the ino_t type is 64-bit, and
 * structures modified for 64-bit inodes (like struct stat) will be used.

 * long long is not supported in c89 (__STRICT_ANSI__), but g++ -ansi and

 * of POSIX, turn on functionality provided by __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ as part
 * of __DARWIN_C_FULL.
 *//*
 * Set a single macro which will always be defined and can be used to determine
 * the appropriate namespace.  For POSIX, these values will correspond to
 * _POSIX_C_SOURCE value.  Currently there are two additional levels corresponding
 * to ANSI (_ANSI_SOURCE) and Darwin extensions (_DARWIN_C_SOURCE)
 *//* POSIX C deprecation macros *//*
 * Deal with all versions of POSIX.  The ordering relative to the tests above is
 * important.
 *//* Deal with various X/Open Portability Guides and Single UNIX Spec. *//* Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.2-1992, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2L. *//* Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.1-1990, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1L. *//*
 * POSIX.1 requires that the macros we test be defined before any standard
 * header file is included.  This permits us to convert values for feature
 * testing, as necessary, using only _POSIX_C_SOURCE.
 *
 * Here's a quick run-down of the versions:
 *  defined(_POSIX_SOURCE)		1003.1-1988
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1L		1003.1-1990
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2L		1003.2-1992 C Language Binding Option
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199309L		1003.1b-1993
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199506L		1003.1c-1995, 1003.1i-1995,
 *					and the omnibus ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1996
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200112L		1003.1-2001
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200809L		1003.1-2008
 *
 * In addition, the X/Open Portability Guide, which is now the Single UNIX
 * Specification, defines a feature-test macro which indicates the version of
 * that specification, and which subsumes _POSIX_C_SOURCE.
 *//*
 * symbol release macros

 * The __DARWIN_ALIAS macros are used to do symbol renaming; they allow
 * legacy code to use the old symbol, thus maintaining binary compatibility
 * while new code can use a standards compliant version of the same function.
 *
 * __DARWIN_ALIAS is used by itself if the function signature has not
 * changed, it is used along with a #ifdef check for __DARWIN_UNIX03
 * if the signature has changed.  Because the __LP64__ environment
 * only supports UNIX03 semantics it causes __DARWIN_UNIX03 to be
 * defined, but causes __DARWIN_ALIAS to do no symbol mangling.
 *
 * As a special case, when XCode is used to target a specific version of the
 * OS, the manifest constant __ENVIRONMENT_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED__
 * will be defined by the compiler, with the digits representing major version
 * time 100 + minor version times 10 (e.g. 10.5 := 1050).  If we are targeting
 * pre-10.5, and it is the default compilation environment, revert the
 * compilation environment to pre-__DARWIN_UNIX03.
 *//* Platform: MacOSX *//* These settings are particular to each product. *//*
 * COMPILATION ENVIRONMENTS -- see compat(5) for additional detail
 *
 * DEFAULT	By default newly complied code will get POSIX APIs plus
 *		Apple API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		Most users will use this compilation environment to avoid
 *		behavioral differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
 *
 * LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple
 *		API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
 *		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
 *		its use is discouraged.
 *
 *		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
 *
 * STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
 *		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
 *		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
 *
 *		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
 *		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
 *
 *		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
 *		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
 *		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
 *		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
 *
 * In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
 * function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
 * tools users add either the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
 * compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being
 * used without a prototype in scope.
 */// __alloc_size/*
 * __alloc_size can be used to label function arguments that represent the
 * size of memory that the function allocates and returns. The one-argument
 * form labels a single argument that gives the allocation size (where the
 * arguments are numbered from 1):
 *
 * void	*malloc(size_t __size) __alloc_size(1);
 *
 * The two-argument form handles the case where the size is calculated as the
 * product of two arguments:
 *
 * void	*calloc(size_t __count, size_t __size) __alloc_size(1,2);
 *//* Source compatibility only, ID string not emitted in object file *//*
 * Compiler-dependent macros to declare that functions take printf-like
 * or scanf-like arguments.  They are null except for versions of gcc
 * that are known to support the features properly.  Functions declared
 * with these attributes will cause compilation warnings if there is a
 * mismatch between the format string and subsequent function parameter
 * types.
 *//*
 * Compiler-dependent macros that bracket portions of code where the
 * "-Wunreachable-code" warning should be ignored. Please use sparingly.
 *//* Unfortunately, we're using a compiler that we don't know how to force to
 * inline.  Oh well.
 *//* If we land here, we've encountered an unsupported compiler,
 * so hopefully it understands static __inline as a fallback.
 *//* Declaring inline functions within headers is error-prone due to differences
 * across various versions of the C language and extensions.  __header_inline
 * can be used to declare inline functions within system headers.  In cases
 * where you want to force inlining instead of letting the compiler make
 * the decision, you can use __header_always_inline.
 *
 * Be aware that using inline for functions which compilers may also provide
 * builtins can behave differently under various compilers.  If you intend to
 * provide an inline version of such a function, you may want to use a macro
 * instead.
 *
 * The check for !__GNUC__ || __clang__ is because gcc doesn't correctly
 * support c99 inline in some cases:
 * http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55965
 *//*
 * __abortlike is the attribute to put on functions like abort() that are
 * typically used to mark assertions. These optimize the codegen
 * for outlining while still maintaining debugability.
 *//*
 * __swift_unavailable causes the compiler to mark a symbol as specifically
 * unavailable in Swift, regardless of any other availability in C.
 *//*
 * __result_use_check warns callers of a function that not using the function
 * return value is a bug, i.e. dismissing malloc() return value results in a
 * memory leak.
 *//*
 * __not_tail_called causes the compiler to prevent tail call optimization
 * on statically bound calls to the function.  It has no effect on indirect
 * calls.  Virtual functions, objective-c methods, and functions marked as
 * "always_inline" cannot be marked as __not_tail_called.
 *//*
 * __disable_tail_calls causes the compiler to not perform tail call
 * optimization inside the marked function.
 *//* Compatibility with compilers and environments that don't support the
 * nullability feature.
 *//*
 * We use `__restrict' as a way to define the `restrict' type qualifier
 * without disturbing older software that is unaware of C99 keywords.
 *//* Delete pseudo-keywords wherever they are not available or needed. *//* __unavailable causes the compiler to error out when encountering
 * code using the tagged function
 *//* __deprecated causes the compiler to produce a warning when encountering
 * code using the deprecated functionality.
 * __deprecated_msg() does the same, and compilers that support it will print
 * a message along with the deprecation warning.
 * This may require turning on such warning with the -Wdeprecated flag.
 * __deprecated_enum_msg() should be used on enums, and compilers that support
 * it will print the deprecation warning.
 * __kpi_deprecated() specifically indicates deprecation of kernel programming
 * interfaces in Kernel.framework used by KEXTs.
 *//* __exported denotes symbols that should be exported even when symbols
 * are hidden by default.
 * __exported_push/_exported_pop are pragmas used to delimit a range of
 *  symbols that should be exported even when symbols are hidden by default.
 *//* __cold marks code used for debugging or that is rarely taken
 * and tells the compiler to optimize for size and outline code.
 *//* __used forces variables and functions to be included even if it appears
 * to the compiler that they are not used (and would thust be discarded).
 *//* __unused denotes variables and functions that may not be used, preventing
 * the compiler from warning about it if not used.
 *//*
 * __pure2 can be used for functions that are only a function of their scalar
 * arguments (meaning they can't dereference pointers).
 *
 * __stateful_pure can be used for functions that have no side effects,
 * but depend on the state of the memory.
 *//* !(__STDC__ || __cplusplus) *//* !NO_ANSI_KEYWORDS *//* convert ANSI C keywords *//*
 * In non-ANSI C environments, new programs will want ANSI-only C keywords
 * deleted from the program and old programs will want them left alone.
 * When using a compiler other than gcc, programs using the ANSI C keywords
 * const, inline etc. as normal identifiers should define -DNO_ANSI_KEYWORDS.
 * When using "gcc -traditional", we assume that this is the intent; if
 * __GNUC__ is defined but __STDC__ is not, we leave the new keywords alone.
 *//* !__GNUC__ *//* delete pseudo-ANSI C keywords *//**//* traditional C preprocessor *//* !__cplusplus *//* delete GCC keyword *//* convert to C++ keyword *//* define reserved names to standard *//* full-blown ANSI C *//*
 * The __CONCAT macro is used to concatenate parts of symbol names, e.g.
 * with "#define OLD(foo) __CONCAT(old,foo)", OLD(foo) produces oldfoo.
 * The __CONCAT macro is a bit tricky -- make sure you don't put spaces
 * in between its arguments.  __CONCAT can also concatenate double-quoted
 * strings produced by the __STRING macro, but this only works with ANSI C.
 *//*
 * Compatibility with compilers and environments that don't support compiler
 * feature checking function-like macros.
 *//* This SDK is designed to work with clang and specific versions of
 * gcc >= 4.0 with Apple's patch sets *//*

 Macros for defining which versions/platform a given symbol can be used.
 
 @see http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#availability
 
 * Note that these macros are only compatible with clang compilers that
 * support the following target selection options:
 *
 * -mmacosx-version-min
 * -miphoneos-version-min
 * -mwatchos-version-min
 * -mtvos-version-min
 *//* for use marking APIs unavailable for swift *//* for use marking APIs available info for Watch OS *//* for use marking APIs available info for tvOS *//* for use marking APIs available info for iOS *//* for use marking APIs available info for Mac OSX *//* for use to document app extension usage *//* __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING *//* 
 * __API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED is used as a version number in API that will be deprecated 
 * in an upcoming release. This soft deprecation is an intermediate step before formal 
 * deprecation to notify developers about the API before compiler warnings are generated.
 * You can find all places in your code that use soft deprecated API by redefining the 
 * value of this macro to your current minimum deployment target, for example:
 * (macOS)
 *   clang -D__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED=10.12 <other compiler flags>
 * (iOS)
 *   clang -D__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED=11.0 <other compiler flags>
 *//*     
    These macros are for use in OS header files. They enable function prototypes
    and Objective-C methods to be tagged with the OS version in which they
    were first available; and, if applicable, the OS version in which they 
    became deprecated.  
     
    The desktop Mac OS X and iOS each have different version numbers.
    The __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING() macro allows you to specify both the desktop
    and iOS version numbers.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_2,__IPHONE_2_0)
    means the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.2 on the desktop
    and first available in iOS 2.0 on the iPhone.
    
    If a function is available on one platform, but not the other a _NA (not
    applicable) parameter is used.  For instance:
            __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_3,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.3, and it
    currently not implemented on the iPhone.

    At some point, a function/method may be deprecated.  That means Apple
    recommends applications stop using the function, either because there is a 
    better replacement or the functionality is being phased out.  Deprecated
    functions/methods can be tagged with a __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED()
    macro which specifies the OS version where the function became available
    as well as the OS version in which it became deprecated.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED(__MAC_10_0,__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was introduced in Mac OS X 10.0, then
    became deprecated beginning in Mac OS X 10.5.  On iOS the function 
    has never been available.  
    
    For these macros to function properly, a program must specify the OS version range 
    it is targeting.  The min OS version is specified as an option to the compiler:
    -mmacosx-version-min=10.x when building for Mac OS X, and -miphoneos-version-min=y.z
    when building for the iPhone.  The upper bound for the OS version is rarely needed,
    but it can be set on the command line via: -D__MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED=10x0 for
    Mac OS X and __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED = y0z00 for iOS.  
    
    Examples:

        A function available in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            extern void mymacfunc() __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);


        An Objective-C method in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            @interface MyClass : NSObject
            -(void) mymacmethod __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);
            @end

        
        An enum available on the phone, but not available on Mac OS X:
        
            #if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
                enum { myEnum = 1 };
            #endif
           Note: this works when targeting the Mac OS X platform because 
           __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED is undefined which evaluates to zero. 
        

        An enum with values added in different iPhoneOS versions:
		
			enum {
			    myX  = 1,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 2.1 and later
			    myY  = 2,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
			    myZ  = 3,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
				...
		      Note: you do not want to use #if with enumeration values
			  when a client needs to see all values at compile time
			  and use runtime logic to only use the viable values.
			  

    It is also possible to use the *_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED in source code to make one
    source base that can be compiled to target a range of OS versions.  It is best
    to not use the _MAC_* and __IPHONE_* macros for comparisons, but rather their values.
    That is because you might get compiled on an old OS that does not define a later
    OS version macro, and in the C preprocessor undefined values evaluate to zero
    in expresssions, which could cause the #if expression to evaluate in an unexpected
    way.
    
        #ifdef __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
            // code only compiled when targeting Mac OS X and not iPhone
            // note use of 1050 instead of __MAC_10_5
            #if __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED < 1050
                // code in here might run on pre-Leopard OS
            #else
                // code here can assume Leopard or later
            #endif
        #endif

 * The rune type below is declared to be an ``int'' instead of the more natural

 * unsigned so that EOF (-1) can be naturally assigned to it and used.  Also,

 * chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
 * ANSI C), but they use __darwin_ct_rune_t instead of int.  By changing it
 * here, you lose a bit of ANSI conformance, but your programs will still
 * work.
 *
 * NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
 * be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wchar_t and
 * rune_t must be the same type.  Also wint_t must be no narrower than
 * wchar_t, and should also be able to hold all members of the largest
 * character set plus one extra value (WEOF). wint_t must be at least 16 bits.

 *		_lbfsize is -_bf._size, else _lbfsize is 0
 *	if _flags&__SRD, _w is 0

 *
 * This ensures that the getc and putc macros (or inline functions) never
 * try to write or read from a file that is in `read' or `write' mode.
 * (Moreover, they can, and do, automatically switch from read mode to

 *
 * _lbfsize is used only to make the inline line-buffered output stream
 * code as compact as possible.
 *
 * _ub, _up, and _ur are used when ungetc() pushes back more characters
 * than fit in the current _bf, or when ungetc() pushes back a character
 * that does not match the previous one in _bf.  When this happens,
 * _ub._base becomes non-nil (i.e., a stream has ungetc() data iff
 * _ub._base!=NULL) and _up and _ur save the current values of _p and _r.
 *
 * NB: see WARNING above before changing the layout of this structure!
 *//* hold a buncha junk that would grow the ABI *//* stdio buffers *//*
 * NB: to fit things in six character monocase externals, the stdio

 * The presence of limit macros are completely optional in C99.  This
 * implementation defines limits for all of the types (exact- and
 * minimum-width) that it defines above, using the limits of the minimum-width
 * type for any types that do not have exact-width representations.
 *
 * As in the type definitions, this section takes an approach of
 * successive-shrinking to determine which limits to use for the standard (8,
 * 16, 32, 64) bit widths when they don't have exact representations. It is
 * therefore important that the definitions be kept in order of decending
 * widths.
 *
 * Note that C++ should not check __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS here, contrary to the
 * claims of the C standard (see C++ 18.3.1p2, [cstdint.syn]).

 *
 * The standard requires that integer constant macros be defined for all the
 * minimum-width types defined above. As 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit minimum-width
 * types are required, the corresponding integer constant macros are defined
 * here. This implementation also defines minimum-width types for every other
 * integer width that the target implements, so corresponding macros are
 * defined below, too.
 *
 * These macros are defined using the same successive-shrinking approach as
 * the type definitions above. It is likewise important that macros are defined
 * in order of decending width.
 *
 * Note that C++ should not check __STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS here, contrary to the
 * claims of the C standard (see C++ 18.3.1p2, [cstdint.syn]).

 * C99 7.18.1.2 Minimum-width integer types.
 * C99 7.18.1.3 Fastest minimum-width integer types.
 *
 * The standard requires that exact-width type be defined for 8-, 16-, 32-, and
 * 64-bit types if they are implemented. Other exact width types are optional.
 * This implementation defines an exact-width types for every integer width
 * that is represented in the standard integer types.
 *
 * The standard also requires minimum-width types be defined for 8-, 16-, 32-,
 * and 64-bit widths regardless of whether there are corresponding exact-width
 * types.
 *
 * To accommodate targets that are missing types that are exactly 8, 16, 32, or
 * 64 bits wide, this implementation takes an approach of cascading
 * redefinitions, redefining __int_leastN_t to successively smaller exact-width
 * types. It is therefore important that the types are defined in order of
 * descending widths.
 *
 * We currently assume that the minimum-width types and the fastest
 * minimum-width types are the same. This is allowed by the standard, but is
 * suboptimal.
 *
 * In violation of the standard, some targets do not implement a type that is
 * wide enough to represent all of the required widths (8-, 16-, 32-, 64-bit).
 * To accommodate these targets, a required minimum-width type is only
 * defined if there exists an exact-width type of equal or greater width.

 ******************************************************************************//*  Implementation details of __sincos and __sincospi allowing them to return
    two results while allowing the compiler to optimize away unnecessary load-
    store traffic.  Although these interfaces are exposed in the math.h header
    to allow compilers to generate better code, users should call __sincos[f]
    and __sincospi[f] instead and allow the compiler to emit these calls.     *//*  __sincospi(x,sinp,cosp) computes the sine and cosine of pi times x with a
    single function call, storing the sine in the memory pointed to by sinp,
    and the cosine in the memory pointed to by cosp.  Edge cases match those
    of separate calls to __sinpi( ) and __cospi( ), and are documented in the
    man pages.
 
    These functions were introduced in OSX 10.9 and iOS 7.0.  Because they are
    implemented as header inlines, weak-linking does not function as normal,
    and they are simply hidden when targeting earlier OS versions.            *//*  __sincos and __sincosf were introduced in OSX 10.9 and iOS 7.0.  When
    targeting an older system, we simply split them up into discrete calls
    to sin( ) and cos( ).                                                     *//*  __sinpi(x) returns the sine of pi times x; __cospi(x) and __tanpi(x) return
    the cosine and tangent, respectively.  These functions can produce a more
    accurate answer than expressions of the form sin(M_PI * x) because they
    avoid any loss of precision that results from rounding the result of the
    multiplication M_PI * x.  They may also be significantly more efficient in
    some cases because the argument reduction for these functions is easier
    to compute.  Consult the man pages for edge case details.                 *//*  __sincos(x,sinp,cosp) computes the sine and cosine of x with a single
    function call, storing the sine in the memory pointed to by sinp, and
    the cosine in the memory pointed to by cosp. Edge cases match those of
    separate calls to sin( ) and cos( ).                                      *//*  __exp10(x) returns 10**x.  Edge cases match those of exp( ) and exp2( ).  *//*  Because these functions are not specified by any relevant standard, they
    are prefixed with __, which places them in the implementor's namespace, so
    they should not conflict with any developer or third-party code.  If they
    are added to a relevant standard in the future, un-prefixed names may be
    added to the library and they may be moved out of this section of the
    header.

    math optimizations like those enabled by -ffast-math are turned on.
    Thus, (somewhat surprisingly) you only get the fast inline
    implementations if such compiler options are NOT enabled.  This is
    because the inline functions require the compiler to be adhering to
    the standard in order to work properly; -ffast-math, among other
    things, implies that NaNs don't happen, which allows the compiler to
    optimize away checks like x != x, which might lead to things like
    isnan(NaN) returning false.                                               
 
    Thus, if you compile with -ffast-math, actual function calls are
    generated for these utilities.                                            *//******************************************************************************

	 * Generate a floating-point number that represents the exponent.
	 * Do this by processing the exponent one bit at a time to combine
	 * many powers of 2 of 10. Then combine the exponent with the
	 * fraction.
	 *//*
	 * Skim off the exponent.
	 *//* One of the digits was the point. *//*
	 * Now suck up the digits in the mantissa. Use two integers to
	 * collect 9 digits each (this is faster than using floating-point).
	 * If the mantissa has more than 18 digits, ignore the extras, since
	 * they can't affect the value anyway.
	 *//*
	 * Count the number of digits in the mantissa (including the decimal
	 * point), and also locate the decimal point.
	 *//*
	 * Strip off leading blanks and check for a sign.
	 *//* Temporarily holds location of exponent in string. *//* Number of mantissa digits BEFORE decimal point. *//* Number of digits in mantissa. *//* Exponent that derives from the fractional part. Under normal
	 * circumstances, it is the negative of the number of digits in F.
	 * However, if I is very long, the last digits of I get dropped
	 * (otherwise a long I with a large negative exponent could cause an
	 * unnecessary overflow on I alone). In this case, fracExp is
	 * incremented one for each dropped digit.
	 *//* Exponent read from "EX" field. *//* Parse a decimal ASCII floating-point number, optionally preceded by white
 * space. Must have form "-I.FE-X", where I is the integer part of the
 * mantissa, F is the fractional part of the mantissa, and X is the exponent.
 * Either of the signs may be "+", "-", or omitted. Either I or F may be
 * omitted, or both. The decimal point isn't necessary unless F is present.
 * The "E" may actually be an "e". E and X may both be omitted (but not just
 * one).
 *//* Table giving binary powers of 10. Entry
 * is 10^2^i. Used to convert decimal
 * exponents into floating-point numbers.
 *//* Largest possible base 10 exponent. Any exponent larger than this will
 * already produce underflow or overflow, so there's no need to worry about
 * additional digits.

	Use an AA-tree to quickly look up properties in objects:

	The level of every leaf node is one.
	The level of every left child is one less than its parent.
	The level of every right child is equal or one less than its parent.
	The level of every right grandchild is less than its grandparent.
	Every node of level greater than one has two children.

	A link where the child's level is equal to that of its parent is called a horizontal link.
	Individual right horizontal links are allowed, but consecutive ones are forbidden.
	Left horizontal links are forbidden.

	skew() fixes left horizontal links.
	split() fixes consecutive right horizontal links.
