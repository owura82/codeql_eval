 * The dirent structure defines the format of directory entries.
 *
 * A directory entry has a struct dirent at the front of it, containing its
 * inode number, the length of the entry, and the length of the name
 * contained in the entry.  These are followed by the name padded to a 4
 * byte boundary with null bytes.  All names are guaranteed null terminated.
 * The maximum length of a name in a directory is MAXNAMLEN when 32-bit
 * ino_t is in effect; (MAXPATHLEN - 1) when 64-bit ino_t is in effect.

 * (other than an OS/2 exe or Win exe with this name). Eberhard Mattes
 * remarks Tue, 6 Apr 93: Moreover, it reports the type of the (new and very
 * bug ridden) Win Emacs as "OS/2 executable".
 * 
 * 3. apptype() uses the filename if given, otherwise a tmp file is created with
 * the contents of buf. If buf is not the complete file, apptype can
 * incorrectly identify the exe type. The "-z" option of "file" is the reason
 * for this ugly code.

 the default memory requirements from 256K to 128K, compile with
     make CFLAGS="-O -DMAX_WBITS=14 -DMAX_MEM_LEVEL=7"
 Of course this will generally degrade compression (there's no free lunch).

 for small objects.

ZEXTERN uLong ZEXPORT crc32_combine OF((uLong crc1, uLong crc2, z_off_t len2));

     Combine two CRC-32 check values into one.  For two sequences of bytes,
   seq1 and seq2 with lengths len1 and len2, CRC-32 check values were
   calculated for each, crc1 and crc2.  crc32_combine() returns the CRC-32
   check value of seq1 and seq2 concatenated, requiring only crc1, crc2, and
   len2.
*//*
     Same as crc32(), but with a size_t length.
*//*
     Update a running CRC-32 with the bytes buf[0..len-1] and return the
   updated CRC-32.  If buf is Z_NULL, this function returns the required
   initial value for the crc.  Pre- and post-conditioning (one's complement) is
   performed within this function so it shouldn't be done by the application.

   Usage example:

     uLong crc = crc32(0L, Z_NULL, 0);

     while (read_buffer(buffer, length) != EOF) {
       crc = crc32(crc, buffer, length);
     }
     if (crc != original_crc) error();

ZEXTERN uLong ZEXPORT adler32_combine OF((uLong adler1, uLong adler2,
                                          z_off_t len2));

     Combine two Adler-32 checksums into one.  For two sequences of bytes, seq1
   and seq2 with lengths len1 and len2, Adler-32 checksums were calculated for
   each, adler1 and adler2.  adler32_combine() returns the Adler-32 checksum of
   seq1 and seq2 concatenated, requiring only adler1, adler2, and len2.  Note
   that the z_off_t type (like off_t) is a signed integer.  If len2 is
   negative, the result has no meaning or utility.
*//*
     Same as adler32(), but with a size_t length.
*//*
     Update a running Adler-32 checksum with the bytes buf[0..len-1] and
   return the updated checksum.  If buf is Z_NULL, this function returns the
   required initial value for the checksum.

     An Adler-32 checksum is almost as reliable as a CRC-32 but can be computed
   much faster.

   Usage example:

     uLong adler = adler32(0L, Z_NULL, 0);

     while (read_buffer(buffer, length) != EOF) {
       adler = adler32(adler, buffer, length);
     }
     if (adler != original_adler) error();
*//*
     These functions are not related to compression but are exported
   anyway because they might be useful in applications using the compression
   library.
*//* checksum functions *//*
     Clears the error and end-of-file flags for file.  This is analogous to the
   clearerr() function in stdio.  This is useful for continuing to read a gzip
   file that is being written concurrently.
*//*
     Returns the error message for the last error which occurred on the given
   compressed file.  errnum is set to zlib error number.  If an error occurred
   in the file system and not in the compression library, errnum is set to
   Z_ERRNO and the application may consult errno to get the exact error code.

     The application must not modify the returned string.  Future calls to
   this function may invalidate the previously returned string.  If file is
   closed, then the string previously returned by gzerror will no longer be
   available.

     gzerror() should be used to distinguish errors from end-of-file for those
   functions above that do not distinguish those cases in their return values.
*//*
     Same as gzclose(), but gzclose_r() is only for use when reading, and
   gzclose_w() is only for use when writing or appending.  The advantage to
   using these instead of gzclose() is that they avoid linking in zlib
   compression or decompression code that is not used when only reading or only
   writing respectively.  If gzclose() is used, then both compression and
   decompression code will be included the application when linking to a static
   zlib library.

   Because Mac OS X doesn't use a static zlib library, these routine are of
   no value for Mac OS X-only applications, and gzclose() is recommended
   instead.
*//*
     Flushes all pending output if necessary, closes the compressed file and
   deallocates the (de)compression state.  Note that once file is closed, you
   cannot call gzerror with file, since its structures have been deallocated.
   gzclose must not be called more than once on the same file, just as free
   must not be called more than once on the same allocation.

     gzclose will return Z_STREAM_ERROR if file is not valid, Z_ERRNO on a
   file operation error, Z_MEM_ERROR if out of memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if the
   last read ended in the middle of a gzip stream, or Z_OK on success.
*//*
     Returns true (1) if file is being copied directly while reading, or false
   (0) if file is a gzip stream being decompressed.

     If the input file is empty, gzdirect() will return true, since the input
   does not contain a gzip stream.

     If gzdirect() is used immediately after gzopen() or gzdopen() it will
   cause buffers to be allocated to allow reading the file to determine if it
   is a gzip file.  Therefore if gzbuffer() is used, it should be called before
   gzdirect().

     When writing, gzdirect() returns true (1) if transparent writing was
   requested ("wT" for the gzopen() mode), or false (0) otherwise.  (Note:
   gzdirect() is not needed when writing.  Transparent writing must be
   explicitly requested, so the application already knows the answer.  When
   linking statically, using gzdirect() will include all of the zlib code for
   gzip file reading and decompression, which may not be desired.)
*//*
     Returns true (1) if the end-of-file indicator has been set while reading,
   false (0) otherwise.  Note that the end-of-file indicator is set only if the
   read tried to go past the end of the input, but came up short.  Therefore,
   just like feof(), gzeof() may return false even if there is no more data to
   read, in the event that the last read request was for the exact number of
   bytes remaining in the input file.  This will happen if the input file size
   is an exact multiple of the buffer size.

     If gzeof() returns true, then the read functions will return no more data,
   unless the end-of-file indicator is reset by gzclearerr() and the input file
   has grown since the previous end of file was detected.
*//*
ZEXTERN z_off_t ZEXPORT gzoffset OF((gzFile file));

     Returns the current offset in the file being read or written.  This offset
   includes the count of bytes that precede the gzip stream, for example when
   appending or when using gzdopen() for reading.  When reading, the offset
   does not include as yet unused buffered input.  This information can be used
   for a progress indicator.  On error, gzoffset() returns -1.
*//*
ZEXTERN z_off_t ZEXPORT    gztell OF((gzFile file));

     Returns the starting position for the next gzread or gzwrite on the given
   compressed file.  This position represents a number of bytes in the
   uncompressed data stream, and is zero when starting, even if appending or
   reading a gzip stream from the middle of a file using gzdopen().

     gztell(file) is equivalent to gzseek(file, 0L, SEEK_CUR)
*//*
     Rewinds the given file. This function is supported only for reading.

     gzrewind(file) is equivalent to (int)gzseek(file, 0L, SEEK_SET)
*//*
ZEXTERN z_off_t ZEXPORT gzseek OF((gzFile file,
                                   z_off_t offset, int whence));

     Sets the starting position for the next gzread or gzwrite on the given
   compressed file.  The offset represents a number of bytes in the
   uncompressed data stream.  The whence parameter is defined as in lseek(2);
   the value SEEK_END is not supported.

     If the file is opened for reading, this function is emulated but can be
   extremely slow.  If the file is opened for writing, only forward seeks are
   supported; gzseek then compresses a sequence of zeroes up to the new
   starting position.

     gzseek returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from
   the beginning of the uncompressed stream, or -1 in case of error, in
   particular if the file is opened for writing and the new starting position
   would be before the current position.
*//*
     Flushes all pending output into the compressed file.  The parameter flush
   is as in the deflate() function.  The return value is the zlib error number
   (see function gzerror below).  gzflush is only permitted when writing.

     If the flush parameter is Z_FINISH, the remaining data is written and the
   gzip stream is completed in the output.  If gzwrite() is called again, a new
   gzip stream will be started in the output.  gzread() is able to read such
   concatenated gzip streams.

     gzflush should be called only when strictly necessary because it will
   degrade compression if called too often.
*//*
     Push one character back onto the stream to be read as the first character
   on the next read.  At least one character of push-back is allowed.
   gzungetc() returns the character pushed, or -1 on failure.  gzungetc() will
   fail if c is -1, and may fail if a character has been pushed but not read
   yet.  If gzungetc is used immediately after gzopen or gzdopen, at least the
   output buffer size of pushed characters is allowed.  (See gzbuffer above.)
   The pushed character will be discarded if the stream is repositioned with
   gzseek() or gzrewind().
*//*
     Reads one byte from the compressed file.  gzgetc returns this byte or -1
   in case of end of file or error.  This is implemented as a macro for speed.
   As such, it does not do all of the checking the other functions do.  I.e.
   it does not check to see if file is NULL, nor whether the structure file
   points to has been clobbered or not.
*//*
     Writes c, converted to an unsigned char, into the compressed file.  gzputc
   returns the value that was written, or -1 in case of error.
*//*
     Reads bytes from the compressed file until len-1 characters are read, or a
   newline character is read and transferred to buf, or an end-of-file
   condition is encountered.  If any characters are read or if len == 1, the
   string is terminated with a null character.  If no characters are read due
   to an end-of-file or len < 1, then the buffer is left untouched.

     gzgets returns buf which is a null-terminated string, or it returns NULL
   for end-of-file or in case of error.  If there was an error, the contents at
   buf are indeterminate.
*//*
     Writes the given null-terminated string to the compressed file, excluding
   the terminating null character.

     gzputs returns the number of characters written, or -1 in case of error.
*//*
     Converts, formats, and writes the arguments to the compressed file under
   control of the format string, as in fprintf.  gzprintf returns the number of
   uncompressed bytes actually written, or a negative zlib error code in case
   of error.  The number of uncompressed bytes written is limited to 8191, or
   one less than the buffer size given to gzbuffer().  The caller should assure
   that this limit is not exceeded.  If it is exceeded, then gzprintf() will
   return an error (0) with nothing written.  In this case, there may also be a
   buffer overflow with unpredictable consequences, which is possible only if
   zlib was compiled with the insecure functions sprintf() or vsprintf()
   because the secure snprintf() or vsnprintf() functions were not available.
   This can be determined using zlibCompileFlags().
*//*
     gzfwrite() writes nitems items of size size from buf to file, duplicating
   the interface of stdio's fwrite(), with size_t request and return types.  If
   the library defines size_t, then z_size_t is identical to size_t.  If not,
   then z_size_t is an unsigned integer type that can contain a pointer.

     gzfwrite() returns the number of full items written of size size, or zero
   if there was an error.  If the multiplication of size and nitems overflows,
   i.e. the product does not fit in a z_size_t, then nothing is written, zero
   is returned, and the error state is set to Z_STREAM_ERROR.
*//*
     Writes the given number of uncompressed bytes into the compressed file.
   gzwrite returns the number of uncompressed bytes written or 0 in case of
   error.
*//*
     Read up to nitems items of size size from file to buf, otherwise operating
   as gzread() does.  This duplicates the interface of stdio's fread(), with
   size_t request and return types.  If the library defines size_t, then
   z_size_t is identical to size_t.  If not, then z_size_t is an unsigned
   integer type that can contain a pointer.

     gzfread() returns the number of full items read of size size, or zero if
   the end of the file was reached and a full item could not be read, or if
   there was an error.  gzerror() must be consulted if zero is returned in
   order to determine if there was an error.  If the multiplication of size and
   nitems overflows, i.e. the product does not fit in a z_size_t, then nothing
   is read, zero is returned, and the error state is set to Z_STREAM_ERROR.

     In the event that the end of file is reached and only a partial item is
   available at the end, i.e. the remaining uncompressed data length is not a
   multiple of size, then the final partial item is nevetheless read into buf
   and the end-of-file flag is set.  The length of the partial item read is not
   provided, but could be inferred from the result of gztell().  This behavior
   is the same as the behavior of fread() implementations in common libraries,
   but it prevents the direct use of gzfread() to read a concurrently written
   file, reseting and retrying on end-of-file, when size is not 1.
*//*
     Reads the given number of uncompressed bytes from the compressed file.  If
   the input file is not in gzip format, gzread copies the given number of
   bytes into the buffer directly from the file.

     After reaching the end of a gzip stream in the input, gzread will continue
   to read, looking for another gzip stream.  Any number of gzip streams may be
   concatenated in the input file, and will all be decompressed by gzread().
   If something other than a gzip stream is encountered after a gzip stream,
   that remaining trailing garbage is ignored (and no error is returned).

     gzread can be used to read a gzip file that is being concurrently written.
   Upon reaching the end of the input, gzread will return with the available
   data.  If the error code returned by gzerror is Z_OK or Z_BUF_ERROR, then
   gzclearerr can be used to clear the end of file indicator in order to permit
   gzread to be tried again.  Z_OK indicates that a gzip stream was completed
   on the last gzread.  Z_BUF_ERROR indicates that the input file ended in the
   middle of a gzip stream.  Note that gzread does not return -1 in the event
   of an incomplete gzip stream.  This error is deferred until gzclose(), which
   will return Z_BUF_ERROR if the last gzread ended in the middle of a gzip
   stream.  Alternatively, gzerror can be used before gzclose to detect this
   case.

     gzread returns the number of uncompressed bytes actually read, less than
   len for end of file, or -1 for error.  If len is too large to fit in an int,
   then nothing is read, -1 is returned, and the error state is set to
   Z_STREAM_ERROR.
*//*
     Dynamically update the compression level or strategy.  See the description
   of deflateInit2 for the meaning of these parameters.  Previously provided
   data is flushed before the parameter change.

     gzsetparams returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the file was not
   opened for writing, Z_ERRNO if there is an error writing the flushed data,
   or Z_MEM_ERROR if there is a memory allocation error.
*//*
     Set the internal buffer size used by this library's functions.  The
   default buffer size is 8192 bytes.  This function must be called after
   gzopen() or gzdopen(), and before any other calls that read or write the
   file.  The buffer memory allocation is always deferred to the first read or
   write.  Three times that size in buffer space is allocated.  A larger buffer
   size of, for example, 64K or 128K bytes will noticeably increase the speed
   of decompression (reading).

     The new buffer size also affects the maximum length for gzprintf().

     gzbuffer() returns 0 on success, or -1 on failure, such as being called
   too late.
*//*
     gzdopen associates a gzFile with the file descriptor fd.  File descriptors
   are obtained from calls like open, dup, creat, pipe or fileno (if the file
   has been previously opened with fopen).  The mode parameter is as in gzopen.

     The next call of gzclose on the returned gzFile will also close the file
   descriptor fd, just like fclose(fdopen(fd, mode)) closes the file descriptor
   fd.  If you want to keep fd open, use fd = dup(fd_keep); gz = gzdopen(fd,
   mode);.  The duplicated descriptor should be saved to avoid a leak, since
   gzdopen does not close fd if it fails.  If you are using fileno() to get the
   file descriptor from a FILE *, then you will have to use dup() to avoid
   double-close()ing the file descriptor.  Both gzclose() and fclose() will
   close the associated file descriptor, so they need to have different file
   descriptors.

     gzdopen returns NULL if there was insufficient memory to allocate the
   gzFile state, if an invalid mode was specified (an 'r', 'w', or 'a' was not
   provided, or '+' was provided), or if fd is -1.  The file descriptor is not
   used until the next gz* read, write, seek, or close operation, so gzdopen
   will not detect if fd is invalid (unless fd is -1).
*//*
ZEXTERN gzFile ZEXPORT gzopen OF((const char *path, const char *mode));

     Opens a gzip (.gz) file for reading or writing.  The mode parameter is as
   in fopen ("rb" or "wb") but can also include a compression level ("wb9") or
   a strategy: 'f' for filtered data as in "wb6f", 'h' for Huffman-only
   compression as in "wb1h", 'R' for run-length encoding as in "wb1R", or 'F'
   for fixed code compression as in "wb9F".  (See the description of
   deflateInit2 for more information about the strategy parameter.)  'T' will
   request transparent writing or appending with no compression and not using
   the gzip format.

     "a" can be used instead of "w" to request that the gzip stream that will
   be written be appended to the file.  "+" will result in an error, since
   reading and writing to the same gzip file is not supported.  The addition of
   "x" when writing will create the file exclusively, which fails if the file
   already exists.  On systems that support it, the addition of "e" when
   reading or writing will set the flag to close the file on an execve() call.

     These functions, as well as gzip, will read and decode a sequence of gzip
   streams in a file.  The append function of gzopen() can be used to create
   such a file.  (Also see gzflush() for another way to do this.)  When
   appending, gzopen does not test whether the file begins with a gzip stream,
   nor does it look for the end of the gzip streams to begin appending.  gzopen
   will simply append a gzip stream to the existing file.

     gzopen can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this
   case gzread will directly read from the file without decompression.  When
   reading, this will be detected automatically by looking for the magic two-
   byte gzip header.

     gzopen returns NULL if the file could not be opened, if there was
   insufficient memory to allocate the gzFile state, or if an invalid mode was
   specified (an 'r', 'w', or 'a' was not provided, or '+' was provided).
   errno can be checked to determine if the reason gzopen failed was that the
   file could not be opened.
*//* semi-opaque gzip file descriptor *//*
     This library supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format with
   an interface similar to that of stdio, using the functions that start with
   "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a gzip
   wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

     All memory allocated by inflateBackInit() is freed.

     inflateBackEnd() returns Z_OK on success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream
   state was inconsistent.
*//*
     inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back
   interface for input and output.  This is potentially more efficient than
   inflate() for file i/o applications, in that it avoids copying between the
   output and the sliding window by simply making the window itself the output
   buffer.  inflate() can be faster on modern CPUs when used with large
   buffers.  inflateBack() trusts the application to not change the output
   buffer passed by the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns.

     inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state
   and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer.
   inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw
   deflate stream with each call.  inflateBackEnd() is then called to free the
   allocated state.

     A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer.
   This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip
   files and writes out uncompressed files.  The utility would decode the
   header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only
   the raw deflate stream to decompress.  This is different from the default
   behavior of inflate(), which expects a zlib header and trailer around the
   deflate stream.

     inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then
   called by inflateBack() for input and output.  inflateBack() calls those
   routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the
   uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error.  The function's
   parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func
   typedefs.  inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the
   number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf.  If
   there is no input available, in() must return zero -- buf is ignored in that
   case -- and inflateBack() will return a buffer error.  inflateBack() will
   call out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len-1].
   out() should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure.  If out()
   returns non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error.  Neither in() nor
   out() are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to
   inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from.
   The length written by out() will be at most the window size.  Any non-zero
   amount of input may be provided by in().

     For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by
   setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in.  If that input is exhausted, then
   in() will be called.  Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before
   calling inflateBack().  If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called
   immediately for input.  If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in
   must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will
   initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 ..  strm->avail_in - 1].

     The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the
   first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called.  These
   descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller-
   supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job.

     On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to
   pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call.  The
   return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR
   if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format error
   in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the nature
   of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly initialized.
   In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be distinguished
   using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned an error.  If
   strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to out() returning
   non-zero.  (in() will always be called before out(), so strm->next_in is
   assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.)  Note that inflateBack()
   cannot return Z_OK.
*//*
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateBackInit OF((z_streamp strm, int windowBits,
                                        unsigned char FAR *window));

     Initialize the internal stream state for decompression using inflateBack()
   calls.  The fields zalloc, zfree and opaque in strm must be initialized
   before the call.  If zalloc and zfree are Z_NULL, then the default library-
   derived memory allocation routines are used.  windowBits is the base two
   logarithm of the window size, in the range 8..15.  window is a caller
   supplied buffer of that size.  Except for special applications where it is
   assured that deflate was used with small window sizes, windowBits must be 15
   and a 32K byte window must be supplied to be able to decompress general
   deflate streams.

     See inflateBack() for the usage of these routines.

     inflateBackInit will return Z_OK on success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any of
   the parameters are invalid, Z_MEM_ERROR if the internal state could not be
   allocated, or Z_VERSION_ERROR if the version of the library does not match
   the version of the header file.
*//*
     inflateGetHeader() requests that gzip header information be stored in the
   provided gz_header structure.  inflateGetHeader() may be called after
   inflateInit2() or inflateReset(), and before the first call of inflate().
   As inflate() processes the gzip stream, head->done is zero until the header
   is completed, at which time head->done is set to one.  If a zlib stream is
   being decoded, then head->done is set to -1 to indicate that there will be
   no gzip header information forthcoming.  Note that Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES can be
   used to force inflate() to return immediately after header processing is
   complete and before any actual data is decompressed.

     The text, time, xflags, and os fields are filled in with the gzip header
   contents.  hcrc is set to true if there is a header CRC.  (The header CRC
   was valid if done is set to one.) If extra is not Z_NULL, then extra_max
   contains the maximum number of bytes to write to extra.  Once done is true,
   extra_len contains the actual extra field length, and extra contains the
   extra field, or that field truncated if extra_max is less than extra_len.
   If name is not Z_NULL, then up to name_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than name_max.  If
   comment is not Z_NULL, then up to comm_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than comm_max.  When any
   of extra, name, or comment are not Z_NULL and the respective field is not
   present in the header, then that field is set to Z_NULL to signal its
   absence.  This allows the use of deflateSetHeader() with the returned
   structure to duplicate the header.  However if those fields are set to
   allocated memory, then the application will need to save those pointers
   elsewhere so that they can be eventually freed.

     If inflateGetHeader is not used, then the header information is simply
   discarded.  The header is always checked for validity, including the header
   CRC if present.  inflateReset() will reset the process to discard the header
   information.  The application would need to call inflateGetHeader() again to
   retrieve the header from the next gzip stream.

     inflateGetHeader returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     This function returns two values, one in the lower 16 bits of the return
   value, and the other in the remaining upper bits, obtained by shifting the
   return value down 16 bits.  If the upper value is -1 and the lower value is
   zero, then inflate() is currently decoding information outside of a block.
   If the upper value is -1 and the lower value is non-zero, then inflate is in
   the middle of a stored block, with the lower value equaling the number of
   bytes from the input remaining to copy.  If the upper value is not -1, then
   it is the number of bits back from the current bit position in the input of
   the code (literal or length/distance pair) currently being processed.  In
   that case the lower value is the number of bytes already emitted for that
   code.

     A code is being processed if inflate is waiting for more input to complete
   decoding of the code, or if it has completed decoding but is waiting for
   more output space to write the literal or match data.

     inflateMark() is used to mark locations in the input data for random
   access, which may be at bit positions, and to note those cases where the
   output of a code may span boundaries of random access blocks.  The current
   location in the input stream can be determined from avail_in and data_type
   as noted in the description for the Z_BLOCK flush parameter for inflate.

     inflateMark returns the value noted above, or -65536 if the provided
   source stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     This function inserts bits in the inflate input stream.  The intent is
   that this function is used to start inflating at a bit position in the
   middle of a byte.  The provided bits will be used before any bytes are used
   from next_in.  This function should only be used with raw inflate, and
   should be used before the first inflate() call after inflateInit2() or
   inflateReset().  bits must be less than or equal to 16, and that many of the
   least significant bits of value will be inserted in the input.

     If bits is negative, then the input stream bit buffer is emptied.  Then
   inflatePrime() can be called again to put bits in the buffer.  This is used
   to clear out bits leftover after feeding inflate a block description prior
   to feeding inflate codes.

     inflatePrime returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     This function is the same as inflateReset, but it also permits changing
   the wrap and window size requests.  The windowBits parameter is interpreted
   the same as it is for inflateInit2.  If the window size is changed, then the
   memory allocated for the window is freed, and the window will be reallocated
   by inflate() if needed.

     inflateReset2 returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent (such as zalloc or state being Z_NULL), or if
   the windowBits parameter is invalid.
*//*
     This function is equivalent to inflateEnd followed by inflateInit,
   but does not free and reallocate the internal decompression state.  The
   stream will keep attributes that may have been set by inflateInit2.

     inflateReset returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent (such as zalloc or state being Z_NULL).
*//*
     Sets the destination stream as a complete copy of the source stream.

     This function can be useful when randomly accessing a large stream.  The
   first pass through the stream can periodically record the inflate state,
   allowing restarting inflate at those points when randomly accessing the
   stream.

     inflateCopy returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source stream state was inconsistent
   (such as zalloc being Z_NULL).  msg is left unchanged in both source and
   destination.
*//*
     Skips invalid compressed data until a possible full flush point (see above
   for the description of deflate with Z_FULL_FLUSH) can be found, or until all
   available input is skipped.  No output is provided.

     inflateSync searches for a 00 00 FF FF pattern in the compressed data.
   All full flush points have this pattern, but not all occurrences of this
   pattern are full flush points.

     inflateSync returns Z_OK if a possible full flush point has been found,
   Z_BUF_ERROR if no more input was provided, Z_DATA_ERROR if no flush point
   has been found, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent.
   In the success case, the application may save the current current value of
   total_in which indicates where valid compressed data was found.  In the
   error case, the application may repeatedly call inflateSync, providing more
   input each time, until success or end of the input data.
*//*
     Returns the sliding dictionary being maintained by inflate.  dictLength is
   set to the number of bytes in the dictionary, and that many bytes are copied
   to dictionary.  dictionary must have enough space, where 32768 bytes is
   always enough.  If inflateGetDictionary() is called with dictionary equal to
   Z_NULL, then only the dictionary length is returned, and nothing is copied.
   Similary, if dictLength is Z_NULL, then it is not set.

     inflateGetDictionary returns Z_OK on success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   stream state is inconsistent.
*//*
     Initializes the decompression dictionary from the given uncompressed byte
   sequence.  This function must be called immediately after a call of inflate,
   if that call returned Z_NEED_DICT.  The dictionary chosen by the compressor
   can be determined from the Adler-32 value returned by that call of inflate.
   The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same dictionary (see
   deflateSetDictionary).  For raw inflate, this function can be called at any
   time to set the dictionary.  If the provided dictionary is smaller than the
   window and there is already data in the window, then the provided dictionary
   will amend what's there.  The application must insure that the dictionary
   that was used for compression is provided.

     inflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (e.g.  dictionary being Z_NULL) or the stream state is
   inconsistent, Z_DATA_ERROR if the given dictionary doesn't match the
   expected one (incorrect Adler-32 value).  inflateSetDictionary does not
   perform any decompression: this will be done by subsequent calls of
   inflate().
*//*
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateInit2 OF((z_streamp strm,
                                     int  windowBits));

     This is another version of inflateInit with an extra parameter.  The
   fields next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized
   before by the caller.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for
   this version of the library.  The default value is 15 if inflateInit is used
   instead.  windowBits must be greater than or equal to the windowBits value
   provided to deflateInit2() while compressing, or it must be equal to 15 if
   deflateInit2() was not used.  If a compressed stream with a larger window
   size is given as input, inflate() will return with the error code
   Z_DATA_ERROR instead of trying to allocate a larger window.

     windowBits can also be zero to request that inflate use the window size in
   the zlib header of the compressed stream.

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate.  In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size.  inflate() will then process raw deflate data,
   not looking for a zlib or gzip header, not generating a check value, and not
   looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream.  This
   is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format
   such as zip.  Those formats provide their own check values.  If a custom
   format is developed using the raw deflate format for compressed data, it is
   recommended that a check value such as an Adler-32 or a CRC-32 be applied to
   the uncompressed data as is done in the zlib, gzip, and zip formats.  For
   most applications, the zlib format should be used as is.  Note that comments
   above on the use in deflateInit2() applies to the magnitude of windowBits.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip decoding.  Add
   32 to windowBits to enable zlib and gzip decoding with automatic header
   detection, or add 16 to decode only the gzip format (the zlib format will
   return a Z_DATA_ERROR).  If a gzip stream is being decoded, strm->adler is a
   CRC-32 instead of an Adler-32.  Unlike the gunzip utility and gzread() (see
   below), inflate() will not automatically decode concatenated gzip streams.
   inflate() will return Z_STREAM_END at the end of the gzip stream.  The state
   would need to be reset to continue decoding a subsequent gzip stream.

     inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the parameters are
   invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure.  msg is set to null if
   there is no error message.  inflateInit2 does not perform any decompression
   apart from possibly reading the zlib header if present: actual decompression
   will be done by inflate().  (So next_in and avail_in may be modified, but
   next_out and avail_out are unused and unchanged.) The current implementation
   of inflateInit2() does not process any header information -- that is
   deferred until inflate() is called.
*//*
     deflateSetHeader() provides gzip header information for when a gzip
   stream is requested by deflateInit2().  deflateSetHeader() may be called
   after deflateInit2() or deflateReset() and before the first call of
   deflate().  The text, time, os, extra field, name, and comment information
   in the provided gz_header structure are written to the gzip header (xflag is
   ignored -- the extra flags are set according to the compression level).  The
   caller must assure that, if not Z_NULL, name and comment are terminated with
   a zero byte, and that if extra is not Z_NULL, that extra_len bytes are
   available there.  If hcrc is true, a gzip header crc is included.  Note that
   the current versions of the command-line version of gzip (up through version
   1.3.x) do not support header crc's, and will report that it is a "multi-part
   gzip file" and give up.

     If deflateSetHeader is not used, the default gzip header has text false,
   the time set to zero, and os set to 255, with no extra, name, or comment
   fields.  The gzip header is returned to the default state by deflateReset().

     deflateSetHeader returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     deflatePrime() inserts bits in the deflate output stream.  The intent
   is that this function is used to start off the deflate output with the bits
   leftover from a previous deflate stream when appending to it.  As such, this
   function can only be used for raw deflate, and must be used before the first
   deflate() call after a deflateInit2() or deflateReset().  bits must be less
   than or equal to 16, and that many of the least significant bits of value
   will be inserted in the output.

     deflatePrime returns Z_OK if success, Z_BUF_ERROR if there was not enough
   room in the internal buffer to insert the bits, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   source stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     deflatePending() returns the number of bytes and bits of output that have
   been generated, but not yet provided in the available output.  The bytes not
   provided would be due to the available output space having being consumed.
   The number of bits of output not provided are between 0 and 7, where they
   await more bits to join them in order to fill out a full byte.  If pending
   or bits are Z_NULL, then those values are not set.

     deflatePending returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.
 *//*
     deflateBound() returns an upper bound on the compressed size after
   deflation of sourceLen bytes.  It must be called after deflateInit() or
   deflateInit2(), and after deflateSetHeader(), if used.  This would be used
   to allocate an output buffer for deflation in a single pass, and so would be
   called before deflate().  If that first deflate() call is provided the
   sourceLen input bytes, an output buffer allocated to the size returned by
   deflateBound(), and the flush value Z_FINISH, then deflate() is guaranteed
   to return Z_STREAM_END.  Note that it is possible for the compressed size to
   be larger than the value returned by deflateBound() if flush options other
   than Z_FINISH or Z_NO_FLUSH are used.
*//*
     Fine tune deflate's internal compression parameters.  This should only be
   used by someone who understands the algorithm used by zlib's deflate for
   searching for the best matching string, and even then only by the most
   fanatic optimizer trying to squeeze out the last compressed bit for their
   specific input data.  Read the deflate.c source code for the meaning of the
   max_lazy, good_length, nice_length, and max_chain parameters.

     deflateTune() can be called after deflateInit() or deflateInit2(), and
   returns Z_OK on success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR for an invalid deflate stream.
 *//*
     Dynamically update the compression level and compression strategy.  The
   interpretation of level and strategy is as in deflateInit2().  This can be
   used to switch between compression and straight copy of the input data, or
   to switch to a different kind of input data requiring a different strategy.
   If the compression approach (which is a function of the level) or the
   strategy is changed, and if any input has been consumed in a previous
   deflate() call, then the input available so far is compressed with the old
   level and strategy using deflate(strm, Z_BLOCK).  There are three approaches
   for the compression levels 0, 1..3, and 4..9 respectively.  The new level
   and strategy will take effect at the next call of deflate().

     If a deflate(strm, Z_BLOCK) is performed by deflateParams(), and it does
   not have enough output space to complete, then the parameter change will not
   take effect.  In this case, deflateParams() can be called again with the
   same parameters and more output space to try again.

     In order to assure a change in the parameters on the first try, the
   deflate stream should be flushed using deflate() with Z_BLOCK or other flush
   request until strm.avail_out is not zero, before calling deflateParams().
   Then no more input data should be provided before the deflateParams() call.
   If this is done, the old level and strategy will be applied to the data
   compressed before deflateParams(), and the new level and strategy will be
   applied to the the data compressed after deflateParams().

     deflateParams returns Z_OK on success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source stream
   state was inconsistent or if a parameter was invalid, or Z_BUF_ERROR if
   there was not enough output space to complete the compression of the
   available input data before a change in the strategy or approach.  Note that
   in the case of a Z_BUF_ERROR, the parameters are not changed.  A return
   value of Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, in which case deflateParams() can be
   retried with more output space.
*//*
     This function is equivalent to deflateEnd followed by deflateInit, but
   does not free and reallocate the internal compression state.  The stream
   will leave the compression level and any other attributes that may have been
   set unchanged.

     deflateReset returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent (such as zalloc or state being Z_NULL).
*//*
     Sets the destination stream as a complete copy of the source stream.

     This function can be useful when several compression strategies will be
   tried, for example when there are several ways of pre-processing the input
   data with a filter.  The streams that will be discarded should then be freed
   by calling deflateEnd.  Note that deflateCopy duplicates the internal
   compression state which can be quite large, so this strategy is slow and can
   consume lots of memory.

     deflateCopy returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source stream state was inconsistent
   (such as zalloc being Z_NULL).  msg is left unchanged in both source and
   destination.
*//*
     Returns the sliding dictionary being maintained by deflate.  dictLength is
   set to the number of bytes in the dictionary, and that many bytes are copied
   to dictionary.  dictionary must have enough space, where 32768 bytes is
   always enough.  If deflateGetDictionary() is called with dictionary equal to
   Z_NULL, then only the dictionary length is returned, and nothing is copied.
   Similary, if dictLength is Z_NULL, then it is not set.

     deflateGetDictionary() may return a length less than the window size, even
   when more than the window size in input has been provided. It may return up
   to 258 bytes less in that case, due to how zlib's implementation of deflate
   manages the sliding window and lookahead for matches, where matches can be
   up to 258 bytes long. If the application needs the last window-size bytes of
   input, then that would need to be saved by the application outside of zlib.

     deflateGetDictionary returns Z_OK on success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   stream state is inconsistent.
*//*
     Initializes the compression dictionary from the given byte sequence
   without producing any compressed output.  When using the zlib format, this
   function must be called immediately after deflateInit, deflateInit2 or
   deflateReset, and before any call of deflate.  When doing raw deflate, this
   function must be called either before any call of deflate, or immediately
   after the completion of a deflate block, i.e. after all input has been
   consumed and all output has been delivered when using any of the flush
   options Z_BLOCK, Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, or Z_FULL_FLUSH.  The
   compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same dictionary (see
   inflateSetDictionary).

     The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely
   to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly
   used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary.  Using a
   dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be
   predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than
   with the default empty dictionary.

     Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by
   deflateInit or deflateInit2, a part of the dictionary may in effect be
   discarded, for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size
   provided in deflateInit or deflateInit2.  Thus the strings most likely to be
   useful should be put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front.  In
   addition, the current implementation of deflate will use at most the window
   size minus 262 bytes of the provided dictionary.

     Upon return of this function, strm->adler is set to the Adler-32 value
   of the dictionary; the decompressor may later use this value to determine
   which dictionary has been used by the compressor.  (The Adler-32 value
   applies to the whole dictionary even if only a subset of the dictionary is
   actually used by the compressor.) If a raw deflate was requested, then the
   Adler-32 value is not computed and strm->adler is not set.

     deflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (e.g.  dictionary being Z_NULL) or the stream state is
   inconsistent (for example if deflate has already been called for this stream
   or if not at a block boundary for raw deflate).  deflateSetDictionary does
   not perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflateInit2 OF((z_streamp strm,
                                     int  level,
                                     int  method,
                                     int  windowBits,
                                     int  memLevel,
                                     int  strategy));

     This is another version of deflateInit with more compression options.  The
   fields next_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by the
   caller.

     The method parameter is the compression method.  It must be Z_DEFLATED in
   this version of the library.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the window size
   (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for this
   version of the library.  Larger values of this parameter result in better
   compression at the expense of memory usage.  The default value is 15 if
   deflateInit is used instead.

     For the current implementation of deflate(), a windowBits value of 8 (a
   window size of 256 bytes) is not supported.  As a result, a request for 8
   will result in 9 (a 512-byte window).  In that case, providing 8 to
   inflateInit2() will result in an error when the zlib header with 9 is
   checked against the initialization of inflate().  The remedy is to not use 8
   with deflateInit2() with this initialization, or at least in that case use 9
   with inflateInit2().

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw deflate.  In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size.  deflate() will then generate raw deflate data
   with no zlib header or trailer, and will not compute a check value.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip encoding.  Add
   16 to windowBits to write a simple gzip header and trailer around the
   compressed data instead of a zlib wrapper.  The gzip header will have no
   file name, no extra data, no comment, no modification time (set to zero), no
   header crc, and the operating system will be set to the appropriate value,
   if the operating system was determined at compile time.  If a gzip stream is
   being written, strm->adler is a CRC-32 instead of an Adler-32.

     For raw deflate or gzip encoding, a request for a 256-byte window is
   rejected as invalid, since only the zlib header provides a means of
   transmitting the window size to the decompressor.

     The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated
   for the internal compression state.  memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but is
   slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory for
   optimal speed.  The default value is 8.  See zconf.h for total memory usage
   as a function of windowBits and memLevel.

     The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm.  Use the
   value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data produced by a
   filter (or predictor), Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only (no
   string match), or Z_RLE to limit match distances to one (run-length
   encoding).  Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a somewhat
   random distribution.  In this case, the compression algorithm is tuned to
   compress them better.  The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more Huffman
   coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between
   Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY.  Z_RLE is designed to be almost as
   fast as Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY, but give better compression for PNG image data.  The
   strategy parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the
   correctness of the compressed output even if it is not set appropriately.
   Z_FIXED prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes, allowing for a simpler
   decoder for special applications.

     deflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any parameter is invalid (such as an invalid
   method), or Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version (zlib_version) is
   incompatible with the version assumed by the caller (ZLIB_VERSION).  msg is
   set to null if there is no error message.  deflateInit2 does not perform any
   compression: this will be done by deflate().
*//*
    The following functions are needed only in some special applications.
*//* Advanced functions *//*
     All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.
   This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any pending
   output.

     inflateEnd returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state
   was inconsistent.
*//*
    inflate decompresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full.  It may introduce
  some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

  The detailed semantics are as follows.  inflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Decompress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly.  If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), then next_in and avail_in are updated
    accordingly, and processing will resume at this point for the next call of
    inflate().

  - Generate more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  inflate() provides as much output as possible, until there is
    no more input data or no more space in the output buffer (see below about
    the flush parameter).

    Before the call of inflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming more
  output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.  If the
  caller of inflate() does not provide both available input and available
  output space, it is possible that there will be no progress made.  The
  application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for example
  when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each call of
  inflate().  If inflate returns Z_OK and with zero avail_out, it must be
  called again after making room in the output buffer because there might be
  more output pending.

    The flush parameter of inflate() can be Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, Z_FINISH,
  Z_BLOCK, or Z_TREES.  Z_SYNC_FLUSH requests that inflate() flush as much
  output as possible to the output buffer.  Z_BLOCK requests that inflate()
  stop if and when it gets to the next deflate block boundary.  When decoding
  the zlib or gzip format, this will cause inflate() to return immediately
  after the header and before the first block.  When doing a raw inflate,
  inflate() will go ahead and process the first block, and will return when it
  gets to the end of that block, or when it runs out of data.

    The Z_BLOCK option assists in appending to or combining deflate streams.
  To assist in this, on return inflate() always sets strm->data_type to the
  number of unused bits in the last byte taken from strm->next_in, plus 64 if
  inflate() is currently decoding the last block in the deflate stream, plus
  128 if inflate() returned immediately after decoding an end-of-block code or
  decoding the complete header up to just before the first byte of the deflate
  stream.  The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the uncompressed
  data from that block has been written to strm->next_out.  The number of
  unused bits may in general be greater than seven, except when bit 7 of
  data_type is set, in which case the number of unused bits will be less than
  eight.  data_type is set as noted here every time inflate() returns for all
  flush options, and so can be used to determine the amount of currently
  consumed input in bits.

    The Z_TREES option behaves as Z_BLOCK does, but it also returns when the
  end of each deflate block header is reached, before any actual data in that
  block is decoded.  This allows the caller to determine the length of the
  deflate block header for later use in random access within a deflate block.
  256 is added to the value of strm->data_type when inflate() returns
  immediately after reaching the end of the deflate block header.

    inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an
  error.  However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step (a
  single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to Z_FINISH.  In
  this case all pending input is processed and all pending output is flushed;
  avail_out must be large enough to hold all of the uncompressed data for the
  operation to complete.  (The size of the uncompressed data may have been
  saved by the compressor for this purpose.)  The use of Z_FINISH is not
  required to perform an inflation in one step.  However it may be used to
  inform inflate that a faster approach can be used for the single inflate()
  call.  Z_FINISH also informs inflate to not maintain a sliding window if the
  stream completes, which reduces inflate's memory footprint.  If the stream
  does not complete, either because not all of the stream is provided or not
  enough output space is provided, then a sliding window will be allocated and
  inflate() can be called again to continue the operation as if Z_NO_FLUSH had
  been used.

     In this implementation, inflate() always flushes as much output as
  possible to the output buffer, and always uses the faster approach on the
  first call.  So the effects of the flush parameter in this implementation are
  on the return value of inflate() as noted below, when inflate() returns early
  when Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES is used, and when inflate() avoids the allocation of
  memory for a sliding window when Z_FINISH is used.

     If a preset dictionary is needed after this call (see inflateSetDictionary
  below), inflate sets strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of the dictionary
  chosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise it sets
  strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of all output produced so far (that is,
  total_out bytes) and returns Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END or an error code as described
  below.  At the end of the stream, inflate() checks that its computed Adler-32
  checksum is equal to that saved by the compressor and returns Z_STREAM_END
  only if the checksum is correct.

    inflate() can decompress and check either zlib-wrapped or gzip-wrapped
  deflate data.  The header type is detected automatically, if requested when
  initializing with inflateInit2().  Any information contained in the gzip
  header is not retained unless inflateGetHeader() is used.  When processing
  gzip-wrapped deflate data, strm->adler32 is set to the CRC-32 of the output
  produced so far.  The CRC-32 is checked against the gzip trailer, as is the
  uncompressed length, modulo 2^32.

    inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed
  or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the compressed data has
  been reached and all uncompressed output has been produced, Z_NEED_DICT if a
  preset dictionary is needed at this point, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was
  corrupted (input stream not conforming to the zlib format or incorrect check
  value, in which case strm->msg points to a string with a more specific
  error), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent (for example
  next_in or next_out was Z_NULL, or the state was inadvertently written over
  by the application), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory, Z_BUF_ERROR
  if no progress was possible or if there was not enough room in the output
  buffer when Z_FINISH is used.  Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, and
  inflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to
  continue decompressing.  If Z_DATA_ERROR is returned, the application may
  then call inflateSync() to look for a good compression block if a partial
  recovery of the data is to be attempted.
*//*
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateInit OF((z_streamp strm));

     Initializes the internal stream state for decompression.  The fields
   next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by
   the caller.  In the current version of inflate, the provided input is not
   read or consumed.  The allocation of a sliding window will be deferred to
   the first call of inflate (if the decompression does not complete on the
   first call).  If zalloc and zfree are set to Z_NULL, inflateInit updates
   them to use default allocation functions.

     inflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the parameters are
   invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure.  msg is set to null if
   there is no error message.  inflateInit does not perform any decompression.
   Actual decompression will be done by inflate().  So next_in, and avail_in,
   next_out, and avail_out are unused and unchanged.  The current
   implementation of inflateInit() does not process any header information --
   that is deferred until inflate() is called.
*//*
     All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.
   This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any pending
   output.

     deflateEnd returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   stream state was inconsistent, Z_DATA_ERROR if the stream was freed
   prematurely (some input or output was discarded).  In the error case, msg
   may be set but then points to a static string (which must not be
   deallocated).
*//*
    deflate compresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full.  It may introduce
  some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

    The detailed semantics are as follows.  deflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Compress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly.  If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and
    processing will resume at this point for the next call of deflate().

  - Generate more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  This action is forced if the parameter flush is non zero.
    Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter
    should be set only when necessary.  Some output may be provided even if
    flush is zero.

    Before the call of deflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming more
  output, and updating avail_in or avail_out accordingly; avail_out should
  never be zero before the call.  The application can consume the compressed
  output when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full (avail_out
  == 0), or after each call of deflate().  If deflate returns Z_OK and with
  zero avail_out, it must be called again after making room in the output
  buffer because there might be more output pending. See deflatePending(),
  which can be used if desired to determine whether or not there is more ouput
  in that case.

    Normally the parameter flush is set to Z_NO_FLUSH, which allows deflate to
  decide how much data to accumulate before producing output, in order to
  maximize compression.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_SYNC_FLUSH, all pending output is
  flushed to the output buffer and the output is aligned on a byte boundary, so
  that the decompressor can get all input data available so far.  (In
  particular avail_in is zero after the call if enough output space has been
  provided before the call.) Flushing may degrade compression for some
  compression algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary.  This
  completes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty stored block
  that is three bits plus filler bits to the next byte, followed by four bytes
  (00 00 ff ff).

    If flush is set to Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, all pending output is flushed to the
  output buffer, but the output is not aligned to a byte boundary.  All of the
  input data so far will be available to the decompressor, as for Z_SYNC_FLUSH.
  This completes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty fixed
  codes block that is 10 bits long.  This assures that enough bytes are output
  in order for the decompressor to finish the block before the empty fixed
  codes block.

    If flush is set to Z_BLOCK, a deflate block is completed and emitted, as
  for Z_SYNC_FLUSH, but the output is not aligned on a byte boundary, and up to
  seven bits of the current block are held to be written as the next byte after
  the next deflate block is completed.  In this case, the decompressor may not
  be provided enough bits at this point in order to complete decompression of
  the data provided so far to the compressor.  It may need to wait for the next
  block to be emitted.  This is for advanced applications that need to control
  the emission of deflate blocks.

    If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with
  Z_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can
  restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if
  random access is desired.  Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade
  compression.

    If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again
  with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated
  avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero
  avail_out).  In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that
  avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to
  avail_out == 0 on return.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed,
  pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was
  enough output space.  If deflate returns with Z_OK or Z_BUF_ERROR, this
  function must be called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated
  avail_out) but no more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an
  error.  After deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations
  on the stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd.

    Z_FINISH can be used in the first deflate call after deflateInit if all the
  compression is to be done in a single step.  In order to complete in one
  call, avail_out must be at least the value returned by deflateBound (see
  below).  Then deflate is guaranteed to return Z_STREAM_END.  If not enough
  output space is provided, deflate will not return Z_STREAM_END, and it must
  be called again as described above.

    deflate() sets strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of all input read
  so far (that is, total_in bytes).  If a gzip stream is being generated, then
  strm->adler will be the CRC-32 checksum of the input read so far.  (See
  deflateInit2 below.)

    deflate() may update strm->data_type if it can make a good guess about
  the input data type (Z_BINARY or Z_TEXT).  If in doubt, the data is
  considered binary.  This field is only for information purposes and does not
  affect the compression algorithm in any manner.

    deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been
  consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to
  Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example
  if next_in or next_out was Z_NULL or the state was inadvertently written over
  by the application), or Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible (for example
  avail_in or avail_out was zero).  Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, and
  deflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to
  continue compressing.
*//*
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflateInit OF((z_streamp strm, int level));

     Initializes the internal stream state for compression.  The fields
   zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by the caller.  If
   zalloc and zfree are set to Z_NULL, deflateInit updates them to use default
   allocation functions.

     The compression level must be Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION, or between 0 and 9:
   1 gives best speed, 9 gives best compression, 0 gives no compression at all
   (the input data is simply copied a block at a time).  Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION
   requests a default compromise between speed and compression (currently
   equivalent to level 6).

     deflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if level is not a valid compression level, or
   Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version (zlib_version) is incompatible
   with the version assumed by the caller (ZLIB_VERSION).  msg is set to null
   if there is no error message.  deflateInit does not perform any compression:
   this will be done by deflate().
*//* The application can compare zlibVersion and ZLIB_VERSION for consistency.

     The application must update next_in and avail_in when avail_in has dropped
   to zero.  It must update next_out and avail_out when avail_out has dropped
   to zero.  The application must initialize zalloc, zfree and opaque before
   calling the init function.  All other fields are set by the compression
   library and must not be updated by the application.

     The opaque value provided by the application will be passed as the first
   parameter for calls of zalloc and zfree.  This can be useful for custom
   memory management.  The compression library attaches no meaning to the
   opaque value.

     zalloc must return Z_NULL if there is not enough memory for the object.
   If zlib is used in a multi-threaded application, zalloc and zfree must be
   thread safe.  In that case, zlib is thread-safe.  When zalloc and zfree are
   Z_NULL on entry to the initialization function, they are set to internal
   routines that use the standard library functions malloc() and free().

     On 16-bit systems, the functions zalloc and zfree must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this if
   the symbol MAXSEG_64K is defined (see zconf.h).  WARNING: On MSDOS, pointers
   returned by zalloc for objects of exactly 65536 bytes *must* have their
   offset normalized to zero.  The default allocation function provided by this
   library ensures this (see zutil.c).  To reduce memory requirements and avoid
   any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of compression ratio, compile
   the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.h).

     The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or progress
   reports.  After compression, total_in holds the total size of the
   uncompressed data and may be saved for use by the decompressor (particularly
   if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in a single step).

    The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
  This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation)
  but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same stream
  interface.

    Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough,
  or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter
  case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

    The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
  the zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
  around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.

    The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
  with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
  gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

    This library can optionally read and write gzip and raw deflate streams in
  memory as well.

    The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
  and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
  file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
  directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.

    The library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash
  even in the case of corrupted input.

 * Copy buf[0 ... nbytes-1] into out[], translating EBCDIC to ASCII.
 *//*
 * The following EBCDIC-to-ASCII table may relate more closely to reality,
 * or at least to modern reality.  It comes from
 *
 *   http://ftp.s390.ibm.com/products/oe/bpxqp9.html
 *
 * and maps the characters of EBCDIC code page 1047 (the code used for
 * Unix-derived software on IBM's 390 systems) to the corresponding
 * characters from ISO 8859-1.
 *
 * If this table is used instead of the above one, some of the special
 * cases for the NEL character can be taken out of the code.
 *//*
 * This table maps each EBCDIC character to an (8-bit extended) ASCII
 * character, as specified in the rationale for the dd(1) command in
 * draft 11.2 (September, 1991) of the POSIX P1003.2 standard.
 *
 * Unfortunately it does not seem to correspond exactly to any of the
 * five variants of EBCDIC documented in IBM's _Enterprise Systems
 * Architecture/390: Principles of Operation_, SA22-7201-06, Seventh
 * Edition, July, 1999, pp. I-1 - I-4.
 *
 * Fortunately, though, all versions of EBCDIC, including this one, agree
 * on most of the printing characters that also appear in (7-bit) ASCII.
 * Of these, only '|', '!', '~', '^', '[', and ']' are in question at all.
 *
 * Fortunately too, there is general agreement that codes 0x00 through
 * 0x3F represent control characters, 0x41 a nonbreaking space, and the
 * remainder printing characters.
 *
 * This is sufficient to allow us to identify EBCDIC text and to distinguish
 * between old-style and internationalized examples of text.
 *//* XXX fix to properly handle chars > 65536 *//*
 * Decide whether some text looks like UTF-8 with BOM. If there is no
 * BOM, return -1; otherwise return the result of looks_utf8 on the
 * rest of the text.
 *//* 1111110x *//* 111110xx *//* 11110xxx *//* 1110xxxx *//* 110xxxxx *//* 11xxxxxx begins UTF-8 *//* 10xxxxxx never 1st byte *//*
			 * Even if the whole file is valid UTF-8 sequences,
			 * still reject it if it uses weird control characters.
			 *//* 0xxxxxxx is plain ASCII *//*
 * Decide whether some text looks like UTF-8. Returns:
 *
 *     -1: invalid UTF-8
 *      0: uses odd control characters, so doesn't look like text
 *      1: 7-bit text
 *      2: definitely UTF-8 text (valid high-bit set bytes)
 *
 * If ubuf is non-NULL on entry, text is decoded into ubuf, *ulen;
 * ubuf must be big enough!
 *//* 0xfX *//* 0xeX *//* 0xdX *//* 0xcX *//* 0xbX *//* 0xaX *//* 0x9X *//* 0x8X *//*            NEL                            *//* 0x7X *//* 0x6X *//* 0x5X *//* 0x4X *//* 0x3X *//* 0x2X *//* 0x1X *//*                              ESC          *//* 0x0X *//*                  BEL BS HT LF VT FF CR    *//* character appears in non-ISO extended ASCII (Mac, IBM PC) *//* character appears in ISO-8859 text *//* character appears in plain ASCII text *//* character never appears in text *//*
 * This table reflects a particular philosophy about what constitutes
 * "text," and there is room for disagreement about it.
 *
 * Version 3.31 of the file command considered a file to be ASCII if
 * each of its characters was approved by either the isascii() or
 * isalpha() function.  On most systems, this would mean that any
 * file consisting only of characters in the range 0x00 ... 0x7F
 * would be called ASCII text, but many systems might reasonably
 * consider some characters outside this range to be alphabetic,
 * so the file command would call such characters ASCII.  It might
 * have been more accurate to call this "considered textual on the
 * local system" than "ASCII."
 *
 * It considered a file to be "International language text" if each
 * of its characters was either an ASCII printing character (according
 * to the real ASCII standard, not the above test), a character in
 * the range 0x80 ... 0xFF, or one of the following control characters:
 * backspace, tab, line feed, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return,
 * escape.  No attempt was made to determine the language in which files
 * of this type were written.
 *
 *
 * The table below considers a file to be ASCII if all of its characters
 * are either ASCII printing characters (again, according to the X3.4
 * standard, not isascii()) or any of the following controls: bell,
 * backspace, tab, line feed, form feed, carriage return, esc, nextline.
 *
 * I include bell because some programs (particularly shell scripts)
 * use it literally, even though it is rare in normal text.  I exclude
 * vertical tab because it never seems to be used in real text.  I also
 * include, with hesitation, the X3.64/ECMA-43 control nextline (0x85),
 * because that's what the dd EBCDIC->ASCII table maps the EBCDIC newline
 * character to.  It might be more appropriate to include it in the 8859
 * set instead of the ASCII set, but it's got to be included in *something*
 * we recognize or EBCDIC files aren't going to be considered textual.
 * Some old Unix source files use SO/SI (^N/^O) to shift between Greek
 * and Latin characters, so these should possibly be allowed.  But they
 * make a real mess on VT100-style displays if they're not paired properly,
 * so we are probably better off not calling them text.
 *
 * A file is considered to be ISO-8859 text if its characters are all
 * either ASCII, according to the above definition, or printing characters
 * from the ISO-8859 8-bit extension, characters 0xA0 ... 0xFF.
 *
 * Finally, a file is considered to be international text from some other
 * character code if its characters are all either ISO-8859 (according to
 * the above definition) or characters in the range 0x80 ... 0x9F, which
 * ISO-8859 considers to be control characters but the IBM PC and Macintosh
 * consider to be printing characters.
 *//* Doesn't look like text at all *//*
 * Try to determine whether text is in some character code we can
 * identify.  Each of these tests, if it succeeds, will leave
 * the text converted into one-unichar-per-character Unicode in
 * ubuf, and the number of characters converted in ulen.
 *//*
 * Encoding -- determine the character encoding of a text file.
 *
 * Joerg Wunsch <joerg@freebsd.org> wrote the original support for 8-bit
 * international characters.

 * Similarly, we intentionally define to nothing the
 * __ptrcheck_abi_assume_single and __ptrcheck_abi_assume_unsafe_indexable

 * define the indexable and unsafe_indexable ones because the diagnostic is
 * better than the silent ABI break.
 *//*
 * We intentionally define to nothing pointer attributes which do not have an
 * impact on the ABI. __indexable and __bidi_indexable are not defined because
 * of the ABI incompatibility that makes the diagnostic preferable.
 *//*
 * __XNU_PRIVATE_EXTERN is a linkage decoration indicating that a symbol can be
 * used from other compilation units, but not other libraries or executables.
 *//*
 * This macro casts away the qualifier from the variable
 *
 * Note: use at your own risk, removing qualifiers can result in
 * catastrophic run-time failures.

 * _DARWIN_FEATURE_ONLY_UNIX_CONFORMANCE indicates only UNIX conforming API

 *//*
 * _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_ONLY_BIT_INODE indicates that the ino_t type may only

 * (and non-zero).  There is no struct stat64 either, as the regular
 * struct stat will already be the 64-bit version.
 *//*
 * _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_BIT_INODE indicates that the ino_t type is 64-bit, and
 * structures modified for 64-bit inodes (like struct stat) will be used.
 *//*****************************************
*  Public darwin-specific feature macros
*****************************************//*
 * long long is not supported in c89 (__STRICT_ANSI__), but g++ -ansi and
 * c99 still want long longs.  While not perfect, we allow long longs for
 * g++.
 *//* If the developer has neither requested a strict language mode nor a version
 * of POSIX, turn on functionality provided by __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ as part
 * of __DARWIN_C_FULL.
 *//*
 * Set a single macro which will always be defined and can be used to determine
 * the appropriate namespace.  For POSIX, these values will correspond to
 * _POSIX_C_SOURCE value.  Currently there are two additional levels corresponding
 * to ANSI (_ANSI_SOURCE) and Darwin extensions (_DARWIN_C_SOURCE)
 *//* POSIX C deprecation macros *//*
 * Deal with all versions of POSIX.  The ordering relative to the tests above is
 * important.
 *//* Deal with various X/Open Portability Guides and Single UNIX Spec. *//* Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.2-1992, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2L. *//* Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.1-1990, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1L. *//*
 * POSIX.1 requires that the macros we test be defined before any standard
 * header file is included.  This permits us to convert values for feature
 * testing, as necessary, using only _POSIX_C_SOURCE.
 *
 * Here's a quick run-down of the versions:
 *  defined(_POSIX_SOURCE)		1003.1-1988
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1L		1003.1-1990
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2L		1003.2-1992 C Language Binding Option
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199309L		1003.1b-1993
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199506L		1003.1c-1995, 1003.1i-1995,
 *					and the omnibus ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1996
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200112L		1003.1-2001
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200809L		1003.1-2008
 *
 * In addition, the X/Open Portability Guide, which is now the Single UNIX
 * Specification, defines a feature-test macro which indicates the version of
 * that specification, and which subsumes _POSIX_C_SOURCE.

 * The __DARWIN_ALIAS macros are used to do symbol renaming; they allow
 * legacy code to use the old symbol, thus maintaining binary compatibility
 * while new code can use a standards compliant version of the same function.
 *
 * __DARWIN_ALIAS is used by itself if the function signature has not
 * changed, it is used along with a #ifdef check for __DARWIN_UNIX03
 * if the signature has changed.  Because the __LP64__ environment
 * only supports UNIX03 semantics it causes __DARWIN_UNIX03 to be
 * defined, but causes __DARWIN_ALIAS to do no symbol mangling.
 *
 * As a special case, when XCode is used to target a specific version of the
 * OS, the manifest constant __ENVIRONMENT_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED__
 * will be defined by the compiler, with the digits representing major version
 * time 100 + minor version times 10 (e.g. 10.5 := 1050).  If we are targeting
 * pre-10.5, and it is the default compilation environment, revert the
 * compilation environment to pre-__DARWIN_UNIX03.
 *//* Platform: MacOSX *//* These settings are particular to each product. *//*
 * COMPILATION ENVIRONMENTS -- see compat(5) for additional detail
 *
 * DEFAULT	By default newly complied code will get POSIX APIs plus
 *		Apple API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		Most users will use this compilation environment to avoid
 *		behavioral differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
 *
 * LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple
 *		API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
 *		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
 *		its use is discouraged.
 *
 *		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
 *
 * STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
 *		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
 *		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
 *
 *		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
 *		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
 *
 *		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
 *		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
 *		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
 *		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
 *
 * In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
 * function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
 * tools users add either the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
 * compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being
 * used without a prototype in scope.
 */// __alloc_size/*
 * __alloc_size can be used to label function arguments that represent the
 * size of memory that the function allocates and returns. The one-argument
 * form labels a single argument that gives the allocation size (where the
 * arguments are numbered from 1):
 *
 * void	*malloc(size_t __size) __alloc_size(1);
 *
 * The two-argument form handles the case where the size is calculated as the
 * product of two arguments:
 *
 * void	*calloc(size_t __count, size_t __size) __alloc_size(1,2);
 *//* Source compatibility only, ID string not emitted in object file *//*
 * Compiler-dependent macros to declare that functions take printf-like
 * or scanf-like arguments.  They are null except for versions of gcc
 * that are known to support the features properly.  Functions declared
 * with these attributes will cause compilation warnings if there is a
 * mismatch between the format string and subsequent function parameter
 * types.
 *//*
 * Compiler-dependent macros that bracket portions of code where the
 * "-Wunreachable-code" warning should be ignored. Please use sparingly.
 *//* Unfortunately, we're using a compiler that we don't know how to force to
 * inline.  Oh well.
 *//* If we land here, we've encountered an unsupported compiler,
 * so hopefully it understands static __inline as a fallback.
 *//* Declaring inline functions within headers is error-prone due to differences
 * across various versions of the C language and extensions.  __header_inline
 * can be used to declare inline functions within system headers.  In cases
 * where you want to force inlining instead of letting the compiler make
 * the decision, you can use __header_always_inline.
 *
 * Be aware that using inline for functions which compilers may also provide
 * builtins can behave differently under various compilers.  If you intend to
 * provide an inline version of such a function, you may want to use a macro
 * instead.
 *
 * The check for !__GNUC__ || __clang__ is because gcc doesn't correctly
 * support c99 inline in some cases:
 * http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55965
 *//*
 * __abortlike is the attribute to put on functions like abort() that are
 * typically used to mark assertions. These optimize the codegen
 * for outlining while still maintaining debugability.
 *//*
 * __swift_unavailable causes the compiler to mark a symbol as specifically
 * unavailable in Swift, regardless of any other availability in C.
 *//*
 * __result_use_check warns callers of a function that not using the function
 * return value is a bug, i.e. dismissing malloc() return value results in a
 * memory leak.
 *//*
 * __not_tail_called causes the compiler to prevent tail call optimization
 * on statically bound calls to the function.  It has no effect on indirect
 * calls.  Virtual functions, objective-c methods, and functions marked as
 * "always_inline" cannot be marked as __not_tail_called.
 *//*
 * __disable_tail_calls causes the compiler to not perform tail call
 * optimization inside the marked function.
 *//* Compatibility with compilers and environments that don't support the
 * nullability feature.
 *//*
 * We use `__restrict' as a way to define the `restrict' type qualifier
 * without disturbing older software that is unaware of C99 keywords.
 *//* Delete pseudo-keywords wherever they are not available or needed. *//* __unavailable causes the compiler to error out when encountering
 * code using the tagged function
 *//* __deprecated causes the compiler to produce a warning when encountering
 * code using the deprecated functionality.
 * __deprecated_msg() does the same, and compilers that support it will print
 * a message along with the deprecation warning.
 * This may require turning on such warning with the -Wdeprecated flag.
 * __deprecated_enum_msg() should be used on enums, and compilers that support
 * it will print the deprecation warning.
 * __kpi_deprecated() specifically indicates deprecation of kernel programming
 * interfaces in Kernel.framework used by KEXTs.
 *//* __exported denotes symbols that should be exported even when symbols
 * are hidden by default.
 * __exported_push/_exported_pop are pragmas used to delimit a range of
 *  symbols that should be exported even when symbols are hidden by default.
 *//* __cold marks code used for debugging or that is rarely taken
 * and tells the compiler to optimize for size and outline code.
 *//* __used forces variables and functions to be included even if it appears
 * to the compiler that they are not used (and would thust be discarded).
 *//* __unused denotes variables and functions that may not be used, preventing
 * the compiler from warning about it if not used.
 *//*
 * __pure2 can be used for functions that are only a function of their scalar
 * arguments (meaning they can't dereference pointers).
 *
 * __stateful_pure can be used for functions that have no side effects,
 * but depend on the state of the memory.
 *//* !(__STDC__ || __cplusplus) *//* !NO_ANSI_KEYWORDS *//* convert ANSI C keywords *//*
 * In non-ANSI C environments, new programs will want ANSI-only C keywords
 * deleted from the program and old programs will want them left alone.
 * When using a compiler other than gcc, programs using the ANSI C keywords
 * const, inline etc. as normal identifiers should define -DNO_ANSI_KEYWORDS.
 * When using "gcc -traditional", we assume that this is the intent; if
 * __GNUC__ is defined but __STDC__ is not, we leave the new keywords alone.
 *//* !__GNUC__ *//* delete pseudo-ANSI C keywords *//**//* traditional C preprocessor *//* delete GCC keyword *//* convert to C++ keyword *//* define reserved names to standard *//* full-blown ANSI C *//*
 * The __CONCAT macro is used to concatenate parts of symbol names, e.g.
 * with "#define OLD(foo) __CONCAT(old,foo)", OLD(foo) produces oldfoo.
 * The __CONCAT macro is a bit tricky -- make sure you don't put spaces
 * in between its arguments.  __CONCAT can also concatenate double-quoted
 * strings produced by the __STRING macro, but this only works with ANSI C.
 *//*
 * Compatibility with compilers and environments that don't support compiler
 * feature checking function-like macros.
 *//* This SDK is designed to work with clang and specific versions of

 Macros for defining which versions/platform a given symbol can be used.
 
 @see http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#availability
 
 * Note that these macros are only compatible with clang compilers that
 * support the following target selection options:
 *
 * -mmacosx-version-min
 * -miphoneos-version-min
 * -mwatchos-version-min
 * -mtvos-version-min
 *//* for use marking APIs unavailable for swift *//* for use marking APIs available info for Watch OS *//* for use marking APIs available info for tvOS *//* for use marking APIs available info for iOS *//* for use marking APIs available info for Mac OSX *//* for use to document app extension usage *//* __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING *//* 
 * __API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED is used as a version number in API that will be deprecated 
 * in an upcoming release. This soft deprecation is an intermediate step before formal 
 * deprecation to notify developers about the API before compiler warnings are generated.
 * You can find all places in your code that use soft deprecated API by redefining the 
 * value of this macro to your current minimum deployment target, for example:
 * (macOS)
 *   clang -D__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED=10.12 <other compiler flags>
 * (iOS)
 *   clang -D__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED=11.0 <other compiler flags>
 *//*     
    These macros are for use in OS header files. They enable function prototypes
    and Objective-C methods to be tagged with the OS version in which they
    were first available; and, if applicable, the OS version in which they 
    became deprecated.  
     
    The desktop Mac OS X and iOS each have different version numbers.
    The __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING() macro allows you to specify both the desktop
    and iOS version numbers.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_2,__IPHONE_2_0)
    means the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.2 on the desktop
    and first available in iOS 2.0 on the iPhone.
    
    If a function is available on one platform, but not the other a _NA (not
    applicable) parameter is used.  For instance:
            __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_3,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.3, and it
    currently not implemented on the iPhone.

    At some point, a function/method may be deprecated.  That means Apple
    recommends applications stop using the function, either because there is a 
    better replacement or the functionality is being phased out.  Deprecated
    functions/methods can be tagged with a __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED()
    macro which specifies the OS version where the function became available
    as well as the OS version in which it became deprecated.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED(__MAC_10_0,__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was introduced in Mac OS X 10.0, then
    became deprecated beginning in Mac OS X 10.5.  On iOS the function 
    has never been available.  
    
    For these macros to function properly, a program must specify the OS version range 
    it is targeting.  The min OS version is specified as an option to the compiler:
    -mmacosx-version-min=10.x when building for Mac OS X, and -miphoneos-version-min=y.z
    when building for the iPhone.  The upper bound for the OS version is rarely needed,
    but it can be set on the command line via: -D__MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED=10x0 for
    Mac OS X and __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED = y0z00 for iOS.  
    
    Examples:

        A function available in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            extern void mymacfunc() __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);


        An Objective-C method in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            @interface MyClass : NSObject
            -(void) mymacmethod __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);
            @end

        
        An enum available on the phone, but not available on Mac OS X:
        
            #if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
                enum { myEnum = 1 };
            #endif
           Note: this works when targeting the Mac OS X platform because 
           __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED is undefined which evaluates to zero. 
        

        An enum with values added in different iPhoneOS versions:
		
			enum {
			    myX  = 1,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 2.1 and later
			    myY  = 2,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
			    myZ  = 3,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
				...
		      Note: you do not want to use #if with enumeration values
			  when a client needs to see all values at compile time
			  and use runtime logic to only use the viable values.
			  

    It is also possible to use the *_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED in source code to make one
    source base that can be compiled to target a range of OS versions.  It is best
    to not use the _MAC_* and __IPHONE_* macros for comparisons, but rather their values.
    That is because you might get compiled on an old OS that does not define a later
    OS version macro, and in the C preprocessor undefined values evaluate to zero
    in expresssions, which could cause the #if expression to evaluate in an unexpected
    way.
    
        #ifdef __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
            // code only compiled when targeting Mac OS X and not iPhone
            // note use of 1050 instead of __MAC_10_5
            #if __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED < 1050
                // code in here might run on pre-Leopard OS
            #else
                // code here can assume Leopard or later
            #endif
        #endif

 * The rune type below is declared to be an ``int'' instead of the more natural

 * ANSI C), but they use __darwin_ct_rune_t instead of int.  By changing it
 * here, you lose a bit of ANSI conformance, but your programs will still
 * work.
 *
 * NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
 * be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wchar_t and
 * rune_t must be the same type.  Also wint_t must be no narrower than
 * wchar_t, and should also be able to hold all members of the largest
 * character set plus one extra value (WEOF). wint_t must be at least 16 bits.

 * The following always hold:

 *	if (_flags&(__SLBF|__SWR)) == (__SLBF|__SWR),
 *		_lbfsize is -_bf._size, else _lbfsize is 0
 *	if _flags&__SRD, _w is 0
 *	if _flags&__SWR, _r is 0
 *
 * This ensures that the getc and putc macros (or inline functions) never
 * try to write or read from a file that is in `read' or `write' mode.
 * (Moreover, they can, and do, automatically switch from read mode to
 * write mode, and back, on "r+" and "w+" files.)
 *
 * _lbfsize is used only to make the inline line-buffered output stream
 * code as compact as possible.
 *
 * _ub, _up, and _ur are used when ungetc() pushes back more characters
 * than fit in the current _bf, or when ungetc() pushes back a character
 * that does not match the previous one in _bf.  When this happens,
 * _ub._base becomes non-nil (i.e., a stream has ungetc() data iff
 * _ub._base!=NULL) and _up and _ur save the current values of _p and _r.
 *
 * NB: see WARNING above before changing the layout of this structure!
 *//* hold a buncha junk that would grow the ABI *//* stdio buffers *//*
 * NB: to fit things in six character monocase externals, the stdio
 * code uses the prefix `__s' for stdio objects, typically followed
 * by a three-character attempt at a mnemonic.
 *//* Define for new stdio with functions. *//* DO NOT REMOVE THIS COMMENT: fixincludes needs to see:

 * The presence of limit macros are completely optional in C99.  This
 * implementation defines limits for all of the types (exact- and
 * minimum-width) that it defines above, using the limits of the minimum-width
 * type for any types that do not have exact-width representations.
 *
 * As in the type definitions, this section takes an approach of
 * successive-shrinking to determine which limits to use for the standard (8,
 * 16, 32, 64) bit widths when they don't have exact representations. It is
 * therefore important that the definitions be kept in order of decending
 * widths.
 *
 * Note that C++ should not check __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS here, contrary to the
 * claims of the C standard (see C++ 18.3.1p2, [cstdint.syn]).

 *
 * The standard requires that integer constant macros be defined for all the
 * minimum-width types defined above. As 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit minimum-width
 * types are required, the corresponding integer constant macros are defined
 * here. This implementation also defines minimum-width types for every other
 * integer width that the target implements, so corresponding macros are
 * defined below, too.
 *
 * These macros are defined using the same successive-shrinking approach as
 * the type definitions above. It is likewise important that macros are defined
 * in order of decending width.
 *
 * Note that C++ should not check __STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS here, contrary to the

 * C99 7.18.1.2 Minimum-width integer types.
 * C99 7.18.1.3 Fastest minimum-width integer types.
 *
 * The standard requires that exact-width type be defined for 8-, 16-, 32-, and
 * 64-bit types if they are implemented. Other exact width types are optional.
 * This implementation defines an exact-width types for every integer width
 * that is represented in the standard integer types.
 *
 * The standard also requires minimum-width types be defined for 8-, 16-, 32-,
 * and 64-bit widths regardless of whether there are corresponding exact-width
 * types.
 *
 * To accommodate targets that are missing types that are exactly 8, 16, 32, or
 * 64 bits wide, this implementation takes an approach of cascading
 * redefinitions, redefining __int_leastN_t to successively smaller exact-width
 * types. It is therefore important that the types are defined in order of
 * descending widths.
 *
 * We currently assume that the minimum-width types and the fastest
 * minimum-width types are the same. This is allowed by the standard, but is
 * suboptimal.
 *
 * In violation of the standard, some targets do not implement a type that is
 * wide enough to represent all of the required widths (8-, 16-, 32-, 64-bit).
 * To accommodate these targets, a required minimum-width type is only
 * defined if there exists an exact-width type of equal or greater width.

 * Scale factor for scaled integers used to count %cpu time and load avgs.
 *
 * The number of CPU `tick's that map to a unique `%age' can be expressed
 * by the formula (1 / (2 ^ (FSHIFT - 11))).  The maximum load average that
 * can be calculated (assuming 32 bits) can be closely approximated using
 * the formula (2 ^ (2 * (16 - FSHIFT))) for (FSHIFT < 15).
 *
 * For the scheduler to maintain a 1:1 mapping of CPU `tick' to `%age',
 * FSHIFT must be at least 11; this gives us a maximum load avg of ~1024.
 *//* MAX *//* MIN *//* Macros for min/max. *//* Macros for counting and rounding. *//* Bit map related macros. *//*
 * MAXPATHLEN defines the longest permissable path length after expanding
 * symbolic links. It is used to allocate a temporary buffer from the buffer
 * pool in which to do the name expansion, hence should be a power of two,
 * and must be less than or equal to MAXBSIZE.  MAXSYMLINKS defines the
 * maximum number of symbolic links that may be expanded in a path name.
 * It should be set high enough to allow all legitimate uses, but halt
 * infinite loops reasonably quickly.
 *//*
 * File system parameters and macros.
 *
 * The file system is made out of blocks of at most MAXPHYS units, with
 * smaller units (fragments) only in the last direct block.  MAXBSIZE
 * primarily determines the size of buffers in the buffer pool.  It may be
 * made larger than MAXPHYS without any effect on existing file systems;
 * however making it smaller may make some file systems unmountable.
 * We set this to track the value of MAX_UPL_TRANSFER_BYTES from
 * osfmk/mach/memory_object_types.h to bound it at the maximum UPL size.
 *//* Clist rounding. *//* Data chars/clist. *//* Quote bytes/cblock - can do better. *//* Clist block size, must be a power of 2. *//* Round a number of clicks up to a whole cluster. *//* Give the base virtual address (first of CLSIZE). *//* for clusters, like PGOFSET *//*
 * Clustering of hardware pages on machines with ridiculously small
 * page sizes is done here.  The paging subsystem deals with units of
 * CLSIZE pte's describing NBPG (from machine/param.h) pages each.

	 * Sigh.  The 2.0.36 kernel in Debian 2.1, at

	 * sections, in core dumps, as specified by
	 * the "Program Linking" section of "UNIX(R) System
	 * V Release 4 Programmer's Guide: ANSI C and
	 * Programming Support Tools", because my copy
	 * clearly says "The first 'namesz' bytes in 'name'
	 * contain a *null-terminated* [emphasis mine]
	 * character representation of the entry's owner
	 * or originator", but the 2.0.36 kernel code
	 * doesn't include the terminating null in the

	 *//* Content of note is always 0 *//*
	 * Contents is __FreeBSD_version, whose relation to OS
	 * versions is defined by a huge table in the Porter's
	 * Handbook.  This is the general scheme:
	 * 
	 * Releases:
	 * 	Mmp000 (before 4.10)
	 * 	Mmi0p0 (before 5.0)
	 * 	Mmm0p0
	 * 
	 * Development branches:
	 * 	Mmpxxx (before 4.6)
	 * 	Mmp1xx (before 4.10)
	 * 	Mmi1xx (before 5.0)
	 * 	M000xx (pre-M.0)
	 * 	Mmm1xx
	 * 
	 * M = major version
	 * m = minor version
	 * i = minor version increment (491000 -> 4.10)
	 * p = patchlevel
	 * x = revision
	 * 
	 * The first release of FreeBSD to use ELF by default
	 * was version 3.0.
	 *//*
	 * The version number used to be stuck as 199905, and was thus
	 * basically content-free.  Newer versions of NetBSD have fixed
	 * this and now use the encoding of __NetBSD_Version__:
	 *
	 *	MMmmrrpp00
	 *
	 * M = major version
	 * m = minor version
	 * r = release ["",A-Z,Z[A-Z] but numeric]

	 *//*
		 * This is a PT_NOTE section; loop through all the notes
		 * in the section.
		 *//*
	 * Loop through all the program headers.
	 *//*
 * Look through the program headers of an executable image, searching
 * for a PT_NOTE section of type NT_PRPSINFO, with a name "CORE" or
 * "FreeBSD"; if one is found, try looking in various places in its
 * contents for a 16-character string containing only printable
 * characters - if found, that string should be the name of the program
 * that dropped core.  Note: right after that 16-character string is,
 * at least in SunOS 5.x (and possibly other SVR4-flavored systems) and
 * Linux, a longer string (80 characters, in 5.x, probably other
 * SVR4-flavored systems, and Linux) containing the start of the
 * command line for that program.
 *
 * SunOS 5.x core files contain two PT_NOTE sections, with the types
 * NT_PRPSINFO (old) and NT_PSINFO (new).  These structs contain the
 * same info about the command name and command line, so it probably
 * isn't worthwhile to look for NT_PSINFO, but the offsets are provided
 * above (see USE_NT_PSINFO), in case we ever decide to do so.  The
 * NT_PRPSINFO and NT_PSINFO sections are always in order and adjacent;
 * the SunOS 5.x file command relies on this (and prefers the latter).
 *
 * The signal number probably appears in a section of type NT_PRSTATUS,
 * but that's also rather OS-dependent, in ways that are harder to
 * dissect with heuristics, so I'm not bothering with the signal number.
 * (I suppose the signal number could be of interest in situations where
 * you don't have the binary of the program that dropped core; if you
 * *do* have that binary, the debugger will probably tell you what
 * signal it was.)
 *//* FreeBSD, 64-bit *//* Linux (tested on core from 2.4.x, short name) *//* Linux (command line) *//* SunOS 5.x, 64-bit (short name) *//* SunOS 5.x, 64-bit (command line) *//* USE_NT_PSINFO *//* SunOS 5.x (short name) *//* SunOS 5.x (command line) *//* FreeBSD *//* Linux 2.0.36 (short name) *//*
 * Try larger offsets first to avoid false matches
 * from earlier data that happen to look like strings.

 * We support multi-level continuations:
 *
 *	At any time when processing a successful top-level match, there is a
 *	current continuation level; it represents the level of the last
 *	successfully matched continuation.
 *
 *	Continuations above that level are skipped as, if we see one, it
 *	means that the continuation that controls them - i.e, the
 *	lower-level continuation preceding them - failed to match.
 *
 *	Continuations below that level are processed as, if we see one,
 *	it means we've finished processing or skipping higher-level
 *	continuations under the control of a successful or unsuccessful
 *	lower-level continuation, and are now seeing the next lower-level
 *	continuation and should process it.  The current continuation
 *	level reverts to the level of the one we're seeing.
 *
 *	Continuations at the current level are processed as, if we see
 *	one, there's no lower-level continuation that may have failed.
 *
 *	If a continuation matches, we bump the current continuation level
 *	so that higher-level continuations are processed.
