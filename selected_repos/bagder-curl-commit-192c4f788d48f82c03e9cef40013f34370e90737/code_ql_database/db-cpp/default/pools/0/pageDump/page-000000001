  (Quote from The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6 IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004
  Edition)

  The basename() function shall take the pathname pointed to by path and
  return a pointer to the final component of the pathname, deleting any
  trailing '/' characters.

  If the string pointed to by path consists entirely of the '/' character,
  basename() shall return a pointer to the string "/". If the string pointed
  to by path is exactly "//", it is implementation-defined whether '/' or "//"
  is returned.

  If path is a null pointer or points to an empty string, basename() shall
  return a pointer to the string ".".

  The basename() function may modify the string pointed to by path, and may
  return a pointer to static storage that may then be overwritten by a
  subsequent call to basename().

  The basename() function need not be reentrant. A function that is not
  required to be reentrant is not required to be thread-safe.

 *
 * FormAdd()
 *
 * Stores a formpost parameter and builds the appropriate linked list.
 *
 * Has two principal functionalities: using files and byte arrays as
 * post parts. Byte arrays are either copied or just the pointer is stored
 * (as the user requests) while for files only the filename and not the
 * content is stored.
 *
 * While you may have only one byte array for each name, multiple filenames
 * are allowed (and because of this feature CURLFORM_END is needed after
 * using CURLFORM_FILE).
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Simple name/value pair with copied contents:
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "name",
 * CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS, "value", CURLFORM_END);
 *
 * name/value pair where only the content pointer is remembered:
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "name",
 * CURLFORM_PTRCONTENTS, ptr, CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH, 10, CURLFORM_END);
 * (if CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH is missing strlen () is used)
 *
 * storing a filename (CONTENTTYPE is optional!):
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "name",
 * CURLFORM_FILE, "filename1", CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE, "plain/text",
 * CURLFORM_END);
 *
 * storing multiple filenames:
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "name",
 * CURLFORM_FILE, "filename1", CURLFORM_FILE, "filename2", CURLFORM_END);
 *
 * Returns:
 * CURL_FORMADD_OK             on success
 * CURL_FORMADD_MEMORY         if the FormInfo allocation fails
 * CURL_FORMADD_OPTION_TWICE   if one option is given twice for one Form
 * CURL_FORMADD_NULL           if a null pointer was given for a char
 * CURL_FORMADD_MEMORY         if the allocation of a FormInfo struct failed
 * CURL_FORMADD_UNKNOWN_OPTION if an unknown option was used
 * CURL_FORMADD_INCOMPLETE     if the some FormInfo is not complete (or error)
 * CURL_FORMADD_MEMORY         if a HttpPost struct cannot be allocated
 * CURL_FORMADD_MEMORY         if some allocation for string copying failed.
 * CURL_FORMADD_ILLEGAL_ARRAY  if an illegal option is used in an array
 *
 ***************************************************************************//* if length unknown do null termination *//* fail *//* no length and a NULL src pointer! *//***************************************************************************
 *
 * memdup()
 *
 * Copies the 'source' data to a newly allocated buffer buffer (that is
 * returned). Uses buffer_length if not null, else uses strlen to determine
 * the length of the buffer to be copied
 *
 * Returns the new pointer or NULL on failure.
 *
 ***************************************************************************//* we have a contenttype by now *//* in case a NULL was passed in *//* default to the previously set/used! *//*

             adjustments. For example, this is the case when connecting to
             an OS400 FTP server: this server supports two name syntaxes,
             the default one being incompatible with standard pathes. In
             addition, this server switches automatically to the regular path
             syntax when one is encountered in a command: this results in
             having an entrypath in the wrong syntax when later used in CWD.
               The method used here is to check the server OS: we do it only

    The 'draft-murray-auth-ftp-ssl' (draft 12, page 7) says:

    Specifically, the PROT command MUST be preceded by a PBSZ
    command and a PBSZ command MUST be preceded by a successful
    security data exchange (the TLS negotiation in this case)

    ... (and on page 8):

    Thus the PBSZ command must still be issued, but must have a
    parameter of '0' to indicate that no buffering is taking place
    and the data connection should not be encapsulated.

    Here's the excecutive summary on what to do:

    PASV is RFC959, expect:
    227 Entering Passive Mode (a1,a2,a3,a4,p1,p2)

    LPSV is RFC1639, expect:
    228 Entering Long Passive Mode (4,4,a1,a2,a3,a4,2,p1,p2)

    EPSV is RFC2428, expect:
    229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||port|)

  *//* this tcpconnect assignment below is a hackish work-around to make the
     multi interface with active FTP work - as it will not wait for a
     (passive) connect in Curl_is_connected().

     The *proper* fix is to make sure that the active connection from the
     server is done in a non-blocking way. Currently, it is still BLOCKING.

 * Custom push and pull callback functions used by GNU TLS to read and write
 * to the socket.  These functions are simple wrappers to send() and recv()
 * (although here using the sread/swrite macros as defined by
 * curl_setup_once.h).
 * We use custom functions rather than the GNU TLS defaults because it allows
 * us to get specific about the fourth "flags" argument, and to use arbitrary
 * private data with gnutls_transport_set_ptr if we wish.
 *
 * When these custom push and pull callbacks fail, GNU TLS checks its own
 * session-specific error variable, and when not set also its own global
 * errno variable, in order to take appropriate action. GNU TLS does not
 * require that the transport is actually a socket. This implies that for
 * Windows builds these callbacks should ideally set the session-specific
 * error variable using function gnutls_transport_set_errno or as a last
 * resort global errno variable using gnutls_transport_set_global_errno,
 * with a transport agnostic error value. This implies that some winsock
 * error translation must take place in these callbacks.
 *
 * Paragraph above applies to GNU TLS versions older than 2.12.3, since
 * this version GNU TLS does its own internal winsock error translation
 * using system_errno() function.

 * hostip.c explained
 * ==================
 *
 * The main COMPILE-TIME DEFINES to keep in mind when reading the host*.c
 * source file are these:
 *
 * CURLRES_IPV6 - this host has getaddrinfo() and family, and thus we use
 * that. The host may not be able to resolve IPv6, but we don't really have to
 * take that into account. Hosts that aren't IPv6-enabled have CURLRES_IPV4
 * defined.
 *
 * CURLRES_ARES - is defined if libcurl is built to use c-ares for
 * asynchronous name resolves. This can be Windows or *nix.
 *
 * CURLRES_THREADED - is defined if libcurl is built to run under (native)
 * Windows, and then the name resolve will be done in a new thread, and the
 * supported API will be the same as for ares-builds.
 *
 * If any of the two previous are defined, CURLRES_ASYNCH is defined too. If
 * libcurl is not built to use an asynchronous resolver, CURLRES_SYNCH is
 * defined.
 *
 * The host*.c sources files are split up like this:
 *
 * hostip.c   - method-independent resolver functions and utility functions
 * hostasyn.c - functions for asynchronous name resolves
 * hostsyn.c  - functions for synchronous name resolves
 * hostip4.c  - ipv4-specific functions
 * hostip6.c  - ipv6-specific functions
 *
 * The two asynchronous name resolver backends are implemented in:
 * asyn-ares.c   - functions for ares-using name resolves
 * asyn-thread.c - functions for threaded name resolves

 * The hostip.h is the united header file for all this. It defines the
 * CURLRES_* defines based on the config*.h and curl_setup.h defines.
 *//* alarm-based timeouts can only be used with all the dependencies satisfied *//Users/owura/Repos/codeql_eval/proj_repos/bagder-curl-commit-192c4f788d48f82c03e9cef40013f34370e90737/curl/lib/hostip4.c&hints0, sizeof(hints)sbufsbufptrsizeof(sbuf)%d"%d"Curl_ipv4_resolve_r failed for %s

       * name lookup. Fixing this would require an extra malloc() and then

       *//* For AIX 4.3 or later, we don't use gethostbyname_r() at all, because of
     * the plain fact that it does not return unique full buffers on each

     * point to the same actual data! This have the unfortunate down-side that

     * all the data is stored in thread-specific memory areas making calls to
     * the plain old gethostbyname() work fine even for multi-threaded
     * programs.
     *
     * This AIX 4.3 or later detection is all made in the configure script.
     *
     * Troels Walsted Hansen helped us work this out on March 3rd, 2003.
     *
     * [*] = much later we've found out that it isn't at all "completely
     * thread-safe", but at least the gethostbyname() function is.
     *//* AIX, Digital Unix/Tru64, HPUX 10, more? *//* Redhat 8, using glibc 2.2.93 changed the behavior. Now all of a
     * sudden this function returns EAGAIN if the given buffer size is too
     * small. Previous versions are known to return ERANGE for the same
     * problem.
     *
     * This wouldn't be such a big problem if older versions wouldn't
     * sometimes return EAGAIN on a common failure case. Alas, we can't
     * assume that EAGAIN *or* ERANGE means ERANGE for any given version of
     * glibc.
     *
     * For now, we do that and thus we may call the function repeatedly and
     * fail for older glibc versions that return EAGAIN, until we run out of
     * buffer size (step_size grows beyond CURL_HOSTENT_SIZE).
     *
     * If anyone has a better fix, please tell us!
     *
     * -------------------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * On October 23rd 2003, Dan C dug up more details on the mysteries of
     * gethostbyname_r() in glibc:
     *
     * In glibc 2.2.5 the interface is different (this has also been
     * discovered in glibc 2.1.1-6 as shipped by Redhat 6). What I can't
     * explain, is that tests performed on glibc 2.2.4-34 and 2.2.4-32
     * (shipped/upgraded by Redhat 7.2) don't show this behavior!
     *
     * In this "buggy" version, the return code is -1 on error and 'errno'
     * is set to the ERANGE or EAGAIN code. Note that 'errno' is not a
     * thread-safe variable.
     *//* DIFFERENCE *//* Linux *//* If the buffer is too small, it returns NULL and sets errno to
     * ERANGE. The errno is thread safe if this is compiled with
     * -D_REENTRANT as then the 'errno' variable is a macro defined to get
     * used properly for threads.
     *//* Solaris, IRIX and more *//*
     * The clearing of the buffer is a workaround for a gethostbyname_r bug in
     * qnx nto and it is also _required_ for some of these functions on some
     * platforms.
     *//* major failure *//*
   * gethostbyname_r() is the preferred resolve function for many platforms.
   * Since there are three different versions of it, the following code is
   * somewhat #ifdef-ridden.
   *//*
 * Curl_ipv4_resolve_r() - ipv4 threadsafe resolver function.
 *
 * This is used for both synchronous and asynchronous resolver builds,
 * implying that only threadsafe code and function calls may be used.
 *
 *//* CURLRES_IPV4 *//* CURLRES_SYNCH *//* synchronous response only *//*
 * Curl_getaddrinfo() - the ipv4 synchronous version.
 *
 * The original code to this function was from the Dancer source code, written
 * by Bjorn Reese, it has since been patched and modified considerably.
 *
 * gethostbyname_r() is the thread-safe version of the gethostbyname()
 * function. When we build for plain IPv4, we attempt to use this
 * function. There are _three_ different gethostbyname_r() versions, and we
 * detect which one this platform supports in the configure script and set up
 * the HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R_3, HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R_5 or
 * HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R_6 defines accordingly. Note that HAVE_GETADDRBYNAME
 * has the corresponding rules. This is primarily on *nix. Note that some unix
 * flavours have thread-safe versions of the plain gethostbyname() etc.

             Note that we set the download maximum even if we read a

 * Highlights from RFC2616 section 3.6 say:

   The chunked encoding modifies the body of a message in order to
   transfer it as a series of chunks, each with its own size indicator,
   followed by an OPTIONAL trailer containing entity-header fields. This
   allows dynamically produced content to be transferred along with the
   information necessary for the recipient to verify that it has
   received the full message.

       Chunked-Body   = *chunk
                        last-chunk
                        trailer
                        CRLF

       chunk          = chunk-size [ chunk-extension ] CRLF
                        chunk-data CRLF
       chunk-size     = 1*HEX
       last-chunk     = 1*("0") [ chunk-extension ] CRLF

       chunk-extension= *( ";" chunk-ext-name [ "=" chunk-ext-val ] )
       chunk-ext-name = token
       chunk-ext-val  = token | quoted-string
       chunk-data     = chunk-size(OCTET)
       trailer        = *(entity-header CRLF)

   The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits indicating the size of
   the chunk. The chunked encoding is ended by any chunk whose size is
   zero, followed by the trailer, which is terminated by an empty line.

    Digest parameters are all quoted strings.  Username which is provided by
    the user will need double quotes and backslashes within it escaped.  For
    the other fields, this shouldn't be an issue.  realm, nonce, and opaque
    are copied as is from the server, escapes and all.  cnonce is generated
    with web-safe characters.  uri is already percent encoded.  nc is 8 hex
    characters.  algorithm and qop with standard values only contain web-safe
    chracters.

       TODO: replace md5 of empty string with entity-body for PUT/POST *//* So IE browsers < v7 cut off the URI part at the query part when they
     evaluate the MD5 and some (IIS?) servers work with them so we may need to
     do the Digest IE-style. Note that the different ways cause different MD5
     sums to get sent.

     Apache servers can be set to do the Digest IE-style automatically using
     the BrowserMatch feature:
     http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_auth_digest.html#msie

    If the "qop" directive's value is "auth" or is unspecified, then A2 is:

          If the "qop" value is "auth-int", then A2 is:

      A2       = Method ":" digest-uri-value ":" H(entity-body)

    (The "Method" value is the HTTP request method as specified in section
    5.1.1 of RFC 2616)

 * C library. Mingw32 links with the dynamic C run-time library by default,
 * so the explicit definition of CSTATIC will keep dllimport from
 * being defined, if desired.
 *
 * MSVC defines the _DLL macro when the compiler is invoked with /MD or /MDd,
 * which means the resulting object code will be linked with the dynamic
 * C run-time library.
 *
 * Technically, it shouldn't be necessary to redefine any functions that
 * the headers for the C library should already contain. Nevertheless, this
 * is here as a safe-guard.
 *
 * TODO: Determine if these macros ever get expanded for Windows. If not,
 * the declspec expansion can probably be removed.
 *//* SLAPD (as a dynamic library exporting symbols) *//* REWRITE library *//* LUTIL library *//* LUNICODE library *//* LDIF library *//* AVL library *//* LDAP library *//* LBER library *//*
 * Support for Windows DLLs.
 *
 * When external source code includes header files for dynamic libraries,
 * the external source code is "importing" DLL symbols into its resulting
 * object code. On Windows, symbols imported from DLLs must be explicitly
 * indicated in header files with the __declspec(dllimport) directive.
 * This is not totally necessary for functions because the compiler
 * (gcc or MSVC) will generate stubs when this directive is absent.
 * However, this is required for imported variables.
 *
 * The LDAP libraries, i.e. liblber and libldap, can be built as
 * static or shared, based on configuration. Just about all other source
 * code in OpenLDAP use these libraries. If the LDAP libraries
 * are configured as shared, 'configure' defines the LDAP_LIBS_DYNAMIC
 * macro. When other source files include LDAP library headers, the
 * LDAP library symbols will automatically be marked as imported. When
 * the actual LDAP libraries are being built, the symbols will not
 * be marked as imported because the LBER_LIBRARY or LDAP_LIBRARY macros
 * will be respectively defined.
 *
 * Any project outside of OpenLDAP with source code wanting to use
 * LDAP dynamic libraries should explicitly define LDAP_LIBS_DYNAMIC.
 * This will ensure that external source code appropriately marks symbols
 * that will be imported.
 *
 * The slapd executable, itself, can be used as a dynamic library.
 * For example, if a backend module is compiled as shared, it will
 * import symbols from slapd. When this happens, the slapd symbols
 * must be marked as imported in header files that the backend module
 * includes. Remember that slapd links with various static libraries.
 * If the LDAP libraries were configured as static, their object
 * code is also part of the monolithic slapd executable. Thus, when
 * a backend module imports symbols from slapd, it imports symbols from
 * all of the static libraries in slapd as well. Thus, the SLAP_IMPORT
 * macro, when defined, will appropriately mark symbols as imported.
 * This macro should be used by shared backend modules as well as any
 * other external source code that imports symbols from the slapd
 * executable as if it were a DLL.
 *
 * Note that we don't actually have to worry about using the
 * __declspec(dllexport) directive anywhere. This is because both
 * MSVC and Mingw provide alternate (more effective) methods for exporting
 * symbols out of binaries, i.e. the use of a DEF file.
 *
 * NOTE ABOUT BACKENDS: Backends can be configured as static or dynamic.
 * When a backend is configured as dynamic, slapd will load the backend
 * explicitly and populate function pointer structures by calling
 * the backend's well-known initialization function. Because of this
 * procedure, slapd never implicitly imports symbols from dynamic backends.
 * This makes it unnecessary to tag various backend functions with the
 * __declspec(dllimport) directive. This is because neither slapd nor
 * any other external binary should ever be implicitly loading a backend
 * dynamic module.
 *
 * Backends are supposed to be self-contained. However, it appears that
 * back-meta DOES implicitly import symbols from back-ldap. This means
 * that the __declspec(dllimport) directive should be marked on back-ldap
 * functions (in its header files) if and only if we're compiling for
 * windows AND back-ldap has been configured as dynamic AND back-meta
 * is the client of back-ldap. When client is slapd, there is no effect
 * since slapd does not implicitly import symbols.
 *
 * TODO(?): Currently, back-meta nor back-ldap is supported for Mingw32.
 * Thus, there's no need to worry about this right now. This is something that
 * may or may not have to be addressed in the future.

**
** OpenLDAP reentrancy/thread-safeness should be dynamically
** checked using ldap_get_option().
**
** The -lldap implementation is not thread-safe.
**
** The -lldap_r implementation is:
**		LDAP_API_FEATURE_THREAD_SAFE (basic thread safety)
** but also be:
**		LDAP_API_FEATURE_SESSION_THREAD_SAFE
**		LDAP_API_FEATURE_OPERATION_THREAD_SAFE
**
** The preprocessor flag LDAP_API_FEATURE_X_OPENLDAP_THREAD_SAFE
** can be used to determine if -lldap_r is available at compile
** time.  You must define LDAP_THREAD_SAFE if and only if you
** link with -lldap_r.
**
** If you fail to define LDAP_THREAD_SAFE when linking with
** -lldap_r or define LDAP_THREAD_SAFE when linking with -lldap,
** provided header definations and declarations may be incorrect.

 * To use the above digest functions with existing code which uses

 * this file), and simply link against libSystem (or System.framework)
 * instead of libcrypto.
 *
 * You can *NOT* mix and match functions operating on a given data
 * type from the two implementations; i.e., if you do a CC_MD5_Init()
 * on a CC_MD5_CTX object, do not assume that you can do an openssl-style
 * MD5_Update() on that same context.

 * For compatibility with legacy implementations, the *Init(), *Update(),
 * and *Final() functions declared here *always* return a value of 1 (one).
 * This corresponds to "success" in the similar openssl implementations.
 * There are no errors of any kind which can be, or are, reported here,
 * so you can safely ignore the return values of all of these functions
 * if you are implementing new code.
 *
 * The one-shot functions (CC_MD2(), CC_SHA1(), etc.) perform digest
 * calculation and place the result in the caller-supplied buffer
 * indicated by the md parameter. They return the md parameter.
 * Unlike the opensssl counterparts, these one-shot functions require
 * a non-NULL md pointer. Passing in NULL for the md parameter
 * results in a NULL return and no digest calculation.

 * Purpose:
 *  A merge of Bjorn Reese's format() function and Daniel's dsprintf()
 *  1.0. A full blooded printf() clone with full support for <num>$
 *  everywhere (parameters, widths and precisions) including variabled
 *  sized parameters (like doubles, long longs, long doubles and even
 *  void * in 64-bit architectures).
 *
 * Current restrictions:
 * - Max 128 parameters
 * - No 'long double' support.
 *
 * If you ever want truly portable and good *printf() clones, the project that
 * took on from here is named 'Trio' and you find more details on the trio web
 * page at http://daniel.haxx.se/trio/

     This precaution was added in commit 2c72732ebf3da5e as a result of bad
     resolution in the windows function use(d).

     The problematic case here is when using the multi_socket API and libcurl
     has told the application about a timeout, and that timeout is what fires
     off a bit early. As we don't have any IDs associated with the timeout we
     can't tell which timeout that fired off but we only have the times to use
     to check what to do. If it fires off too early, we don't run the correct
     actions and we don't tell the application again about the same timeout as
     was already first in the queue...

     Originally we made the timeouts run 40 milliseconds early on all systems,
     but now we have an #ifdef setup to provide a decent precaution inaccuracy
     margin.
  *//* set data to NULL again to avoid calling
                      multi_runsingle() in case there's no need to *//* Now we fall-through and do the timer-based stuff, since we don't want
         to force the user to have to deal with timeouts as long as at least

         head.  If we should read from the socket, take the recv_pipe head. *//* bad bad bad bad bad bad bad *//* Unmatched socket, we can't act on it but we ignore this fact.  In
         real-world tests it has been proved that libevent can in fact give
         the application actions even though the socket was just previously
         asked to get removed, so thus we better survive stray socket actions
         and just move on. *//* or should we fall-through and do the timer-based stuff? *//* walk through each easy handle and do the socket state change magic

 *
 * Each SessionHandle has a list of timeouts. The add_next_timeout() is called
 * when it has just been removed from the splay tree because the timeout has
 * expired. This function is then to advance in the list to pick the next
 * timeout to use (skip the already expired ones) and add this node back to
 * the splay tree again.
 *
 * The splay tree only has each sessionhandle as a single node and the nearest
 * timeout is used to sort it on.

     the same timer infor will not trigger and then the new handle's timeout
     will not be notified to the app.

 * Quote from README.multi_socket:
 *
 * "Some tests at 7000 and 9000 connections showed that the socket hash lookup
 * is somewhat of a bottle neck. Its current implementation may be a bit too
 * limiting. It simply has a fixed-size array, and on each entry in the array
 * it has a linked list with entries. So the hash only checks which list to
 * scan through. The code I had used so for used a list with merely 7 slots
 * (as that is what the DNS hash uses) but with 7000 connections that would
 * make an average of 1000 nodes in each list to run through. I upped that to
 * 97 slots (I believe a prime is suitable) and noticed a significant speed
 * increase.  I need to reconsider the hash implementation or use a rather
 * large default value like this. At 9000 connections I was still below 10us
 * per call."
 *
 *//*
 * free a sockhash entry
 *//* We remove the hash entry. (This'll end up in a call to
       sh_freeentry().) *//* this socket is in the hash *//* delete the given socket + handle from the hash *//* things are good in sockhash land *//* make/add new hash entry *//* not present, add it *//* it is present, return fine *//* make sure this socket is present in the hash for this handle *//* bits for 'action' having no bits means this socket is not expecting any
   action *//* settable by users with curl_multi_assign() *//* mainly to ease debugging *//* what action READ/WRITE this socket waits for *//*
 * We add one of these structs to the sockhash for a particular socket
 *//* changing to COMPLETED means there's one less easy handle 'alive' *//* don't bother when the new state is the same as the old state *//* always use this function to change state, to make debugging easier *//*
  CURL_SOCKET_HASH_TABLE_SIZE should be a prime number. Increasing it from 97
  to 911 takes on a 32-bit machine 4 x 804 = 3211 more bytes.  Still, every
  CURL handle takes 45-50 K memory, therefore this 3K are not significant.

     all the work-arounds and that "It is usually safe to use SSL_OP_ALL to
     enable the bug workaround options if compatibility with somewhat broken
     implementations is desired."

     The "-no_ticket" option was introduced in Openssl0.9.8j. It's a flag to
     disable "rfc4507bis session ticket support".  rfc4507bis was later turned
     into the proper RFC5077 it seems: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077

     The enabled extension concerns the session management. I wonder how often
     libcurl stops a connection and then resumes a TLS session. also, sending
     the session data is some overhead. .I suggest that you just use your
     proposed patch (which explicitly disables TICKET).

     If someone writes an application with libcurl and openssl who wants to
     enable the feature, one can do this in the SSL callback.

     SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG option enabling allowed proper
     interoperability with web server Netscape Enterprise Server 2.0.1 which
     was released back in 1996.

     Due to CVE-2010-4180, option SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG has
     become ineffective as of OpenSSL 0.9.8q and 1.0.0c. In order to mitigate
     CVE-2010-4180 when using previous OpenSSL versions we no longer enable
     this option regardless of OpenSSL version and SSL_OP_ALL definition.

     OpenSSL added a work-around for a SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 CBC vulnerability
     (http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt). In 0.9.6e they added a bit to
     SSL_OP_ALL that _disables_ that work-around despite the fact that
     SSL_OP_ALL is documented to do "rather harmless" workarounds. In order to
     keep the secure work-around, the SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS bit
     must not be set.
  *//* the SSL trace callback is only used for verbose logging so we only
       inform about failures of setting it *//* Make funny stuff to get random input *//* ====================================================== *//* SSLv2 doesn't seem to have TLS record-type headers, so OpenSSL
   * always pass-up content-type as 0. But the interesting message-type
   * is at 'buf[0]'.
   *//*
 * Our callback from the SSL/TLS layers.
 *//* The SSL_CTRL_SET_MSG_CALLBACK doesn't exist in ancient OpenSSL versions
   and thus this cannot be done there. *//* error already detected, pass through *//* Curl_convert_from_utf8 calls failf if unsuccessful *//* convert peer_CN from UTF8 *//* there was a terminating zero before the end of string, this
             cannot match and we return failure! *//* not a UTF8 name *//* In OpenSSL 0.9.7d and earlier, ASN1_STRING_to_UTF8 fails if the input
         is already UTF-8 encoded. We check for this case and copy the raw
         string manually to avoid the problem. This code can be made
         conditional in the future when OpenSSL has been fixed. Work-around
         brought by Alexis S. L. Carvalho. *//* we have the name entry and we will now convert this to a string
       that we can use for comparison. Doing this we support BMPstring,
       UTF8 etc. *//* The following is done because of a bug in 0.9.6b *//* we have to look to the last occurrence of a commonName in the
       distinguished one to get the most significant one. *//* an alternative name field existed, but didn't match and then
       we MUST fail *//* an alternative name matched the server hostname *//* compare alternative IP address if the data chunk is the same size
             our server IP address is *//* IP address comparison *//* if this isn't true, there was an embedded zero in the name
                string and we cannot match it. *//* The OpenSSL man page explicitly says: "In general it cannot be
             assumed that the data returned by ASN1_STRING_data() is null
             terminated or does not contain embedded nulls." But also that
             "The actual format of the data will depend on the actual string
             type itself: for example for and IA5String the data will be ASCII"

             Gisle researched the OpenSSL sources:
             "I checked the 0.9.6 and 0.9.8 sources before my patch and
             it always 0-terminates an IA5String."
          *//* name/pattern comparison *//* get data and length *//* only check alternatives of the same type the target is *//* get a handle to alternative name number i *//* loop through all alternatives while none has matched *//* get amount of alternatives, RFC2459 claims there MUST be at least
       one, but we don't depend on it... *//* get a "list" of alternative names *//* target type, GEN_DNS or GEN_IPADD *//* -1 is no alternative match yet, 1 means match and 0
                       means mismatch *//* Quote from RFC2818 section 3.1 "Server Identity"

   If a subjectAltName extension of type dNSName is present, that MUST
   be used as the identity. Otherwise, the (most specific) Common Name
   field in the Subject field of the certificate MUST be used. Although
   the use of the Common Name is existing practice, it is deprecated and
   Certification Authorities are encouraged to use the dNSName instead.

   Matching is performed using the matching rules specified by
   [RFC2459].  If more than one identity of a given type is present in
   the certificate (e.g., more than one dNSName name, a match in any one
   of the set is considered acceptable.) Names may contain the wildcard
   character * which is considered to match any single domain name
   component or component fragment. E.g., *.a.com matches foo.a.com but
   not bar.foo.a.com. f*.com matches foo.com but not bar.com.

   In some cases, the URI is specified as an IP address rather than a
   hostname. In this case, the iPAddress subjectAltName must be present
   in the certificate and must exactly match the IP in the URI.

     According to the RFC1013 it is valid:
     A value equal to zero is acceptable for the width (or height),
         and means that no character width (or height) is being sent.
         In this case, the width (or height) that will be assumed by the
         Telnet server is operating system specific (it will probably be
         based upon the terminal type information that may have been sent
         using the TERMINAL TYPE Telnet option). *//* We must allow the server to echo what we sent
         but it is not necessary to request the server
         to do so (it might forces the server to close
         the connection). Hence, we ignore ECHO in the
         negotiate function

    Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed
    to change the method on the redirected request.  However, most
    existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303
    response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless
    of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have
    been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which
    kind of reaction is expected of the client.

    (From 10.3.4)

    Note: Many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 303
    status. When interoperability with such clients is a concern, the
    302 status code may be used instead, since most user agents react
    to a 302 response as described here for 303.

    This behavior can be overridden with CURLOPT_POSTREDIR

     if conn->bits.close is TRUE, it means that the connection should be
     closed in spite of all our efforts to be nice, due to protocol
     restrictions in our or the server's end

     if premature is TRUE, it means this connection was said to be DONE before
     the entire request operation is complete and thus we can't know in what
     state it is for re-using, so we're forced to close it. In a perfect world

     but currently we have no such detail knowledge.

       many callbacks and protocols work differently, we could potentially do
       this more fine-grained in the future. *//* done with this *//* Cleanup possible redirect junk *//* called just now! *//* Stop if pipeline is not empty and we do not have to close

           RFC1738 (section 3.1, page 5) says:

           The rest of the locator consists of data specific to the scheme,

           specified resource can be accessed. Note that the "/" between the
           host (or port) and the url-path is NOT part of the url-path.

           As most agents use file://localhost/foo to get '/foo' although the
           slash preceding foo is a separator and not a slash for the path,
           a URL as file://localhost//foo must be valid as well, to refer to
           the same file with an absolute path.
        *//* the URL included a host name, we ignore host names in file:// URLs
         as the standards don't define what to do with them *//*
     * we deal with file://<host>/<path> differently since it supports no
     * hostname other than "localhost" and "127.0.0.1", which is unique among
     * the URL protocols specified in RFC 1738
     *//* This cannot be done with strcpy() in a portable manner, since the
         memory areas overlap! *//* Allow omitted hostname (e.g. file:/<path>).  This is not strictly
       * speaking a valid file: URL by RFC 1738, but treating file:/<path> as

           This comparison is a bit rough and too strict. Since the input
           parameters can be specified in numerous ways and still end up the
           same it would take a lot of processing to make it really accurate.
           Instead, this matching will assume that re-uses of bound connections
           will most likely also re-use the exact same binding parameters and
           missing out a few edge cases shouldn't hurt anyone very much.

curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
 of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
 bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
 using the --cacert option.
CURL_CA_CERT_ERRORMSG1char[293]If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
 the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
 problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
 not match the domain name in the URL).
If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
 the -k (or --insecure) option.

 *
 * On non-VAX systems, use LIB$INITIALIZE to set a collection of C
 * RTL features without using the DECC$* logical name method, nor
 * requiring the user to define the corresponding logical names.
 *//* curlmsg.h is out of sync.  *//* If CURL_LAST exceeded then *//* The Posix exit mode is only available after VMS 7.0 *//*
 * VMS has two exit() routines.  When running under a Unix style shell, then
 * Unix style and the __posix_exit() routine is used.
 *
 * When running under the DCL shell, then the VMS encoded codes and decc$exit()
 * is used.
 *
 * We can not use exit() or return a code from main() because the actual
 * routine called depends on both the compiler version, compile options, and
 * feature macro settings, and one of the exit routines is hidden at compile
 * time.
 *
 * Since we want Curl to work properly under the VMS DCL shell and Unix
 * shells under VMS, this routine should compile correctly regardless of
 * the settings.
 *//* Have to make sure some one did not set shell to DCL *//* No shell, means DCL *//* Have we checked the shell yet? *//* VMS has a DCL shell and and also has Unix shells ported to it.
 * When curl is running under a Unix shell, we want it to be as much
 * like Unix as possible.
